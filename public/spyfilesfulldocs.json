Before the violence started, there\nhad already been announcements about the tens of\nthousands of police staff cuts being made over the\nnext four years.\n\nsecurity and resilience field. Further positions\ninclude maximising the UK share of the global\nsecurity market and aligning science and\ntechnology priorities for national security and\nresilience purposes. It is anticipated that reference\nwill be made to these positions in the White Paper\non Equipment, Support and Technology for UK\nDefence and Security produced by HMG.\n\nWe have no wish to profit from this mindless\nlawlessness or to pre-empt the findings of the\ninevitable inquiries into London's riots and the\ncopycat events which followed in other parts of the\ncountry leading to the recall of Parliament from its\nsummer recess. It is clear, however, that domestic\nlaw and order must now respond with fresh\nimpetus and that our industry must be ready to be\npart of that process if called upon.\n\nAlDlS welcomes the addition of the Security\nInnovation Technology Consortium (SITC) under\nits umbrella. SITC has done much work in recent\nyears in promoting start up security SMEs and\nworking closely together with academia and\nGovernment in the areas of science, innovation\nand technology.\n\nThe transformation of the police service is\nimperative; it is about process, people and\ntechnology working together to cut costs and\nimprove performance. It is now more important\nthan ever for Government to offer a vision of the\nfuture and a guiding strategic framework for\ntransformation to continue, Industry has a key role\nfor assisting in this transformation and has much\nmore to offer. There is much work to be completed\nby both police and industry to enhance the\npartnering with each other.\nThe Security Resilience Industry Suppliers\nCommunity (RISC) is working closely with HMlC\nculminating with a presentation to the Police\nMinister in the autumn specifically with regard to\ncurrent and future police transformation initiatives.\nRISC continues to support the Government\nsecurity policy with regard to UK national security\nand resilience. The industrial policy positions\ninclude areas such as widening and deepening the\nscope of industrial engagement, developing a\nrobust framework for security standards and a\nmore coherent approach to procurement in the\n\nSir lan Andrews, Chairman of SOCA (the Serious\nOrganised Crime Agency), was guest speaker at\nthis year's AlDlS Security Annual Reception which\nwas held on 7th July at New Scotland Yard. It was\nanother opportunity for industry, police and\nGovernment departments to exchange information\nand to network.\nWith regard to forthcoming events, PSE London\norganised by AlDlS is an opportunity for industry\nto display its innovative products and services to\nthe Police and Security Services. This event, by\npopular demand, is the third one to take place in\nLondon and will be held at the Park Plaza Hotel in\nVictoria on 29th September, 2011.\nAn exciting development for July 2012 is the\nincorporation of an Aviation Security, resilience\nand cyber zone at the FIA. This will be an\nopportunity to link aviation security with areas of\ncivil aviation, defence and space at the world's\nleading airshow.\n\nBob Rose\nDirector, Public Security\nEditor-in-Chief, PUBLIC SECURlTY\n\n-Ex&%\n\nChainnan\n\n- Chief WW\nMsi\n\nLwke Bailey\n-Emand\nMembershipManager\nRwnsible for UK and\noverseas liaison for\nexhibitions, the Security\nExpoti Focus Group\n(SEFG) and membership\nliaison\n+44 (0)207 W 7 8 2 5\n\n-Business Oevelopm\nResponsiblefor\nmanaging the London\nOlympic Group (LOG)\nET1 Awards and Annu;\nReception\n444 (0)mr 09178\n\n- Probt Manager\n- Sewrily\nA former police\nspecialist in community,\npreventativeand IT work\n+44 '\"'\"7 091 7843\n\nI\n\nlracey n l g\n\n- Secur~tySector\nSupport\n\nI\n\nalepnen Phipson\n- CBE Vice IPres~den\noiAlDlS Secur~tyPI//,\n\nHugo Rosemount\n- Policy Adviser\n\nSir Edward Crew\n\n-Security and Resilience\n+44 (0)207 091 4528\n\n- Sewriw CowI&nl\n\nQPM,D1\n\nPUBLIC SECURITY Issue 54\n\n\n\fG\n..\n\n\nPeliTM\nC:\n\ns & Lightin\n\nwherever you are.. .\n..whatever you do\n\n\fAIDIS SECURITY lNEWS\n\n&SI\n\nAerospace Defence Security\n\nOther business\nfrom the meeting\nI\n\nThe SEFG agreed that an executive\nmeeting should be called to draw up a\nlist of the other countries which AlDlS\ngroups will visit during 2012.\nOne surprise entry on the list could well\nbe Australia after a survey to find out\nmembers' favourite export markets\nrevealed that four or five companies\nhave been doing well Down Under.\nAlDlS has not previously taken any\ngroups there, but the poll results could\nnow change all that.\n\nPublic Security Exhibition is being\norganised in Warsaw by AlDlS for the third\ntime because Poland has been less affected\nby the global recession than most other\ncountries.\n\nA\n\nThe Group's quarterly meeting, which took\nplace in London during May and attracted a\nrecord turnout of delegates, also heard about\narrangements for other PSEs in Eastern\nEurope and the Middle East.\n\nThe Security Export Focus Group was told\nthat the event was being planned for 30th\nNovember with the help of the UKTl\ncommercial team stationed in Warsaw and\nAlDlS would be taking a group of member\ncompanies following the success of its two\nprevious missions there.\n\nIt is intended to hold an event for the first time\nin the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, which with 1.6\nmillion people in its metropolitan area, is the\n12th most populous city in the European\nUnion, and the early signs are that this will be\na really good event. It is due to take place on\n9th November.\n\n\"It seems that a number of our companies\nhave had some really good successes in\nPoland and it is almost business as usual over\nthere,\" said Ray Lee, the AlDlS Events and\nMembership Manager who has special\nresponsibility for the SEFG.\n\nA second visit is planned to the Turkish\ncapital, Ankara, in 2012. The PSE planned for\nCairo this year has been called off because of\nthe recent troubles, but the situation there is\nimproving and an AlDlS delegation will\n¤\nconsider going there next year.\n\nOther member companies have been\ndoing well in South America particularly Colombia, Brazil and\nArgentina - and these too may become\nvenues for PSEs.\nA future seminar may be held in London\nduring October about the possibility of\nemerging opportunities in Iraq for UK\nsecurity companies. This topic is dealt\nwith more fully on page 22\nThe Group also heard from accountants\nChantrey Vellacott DFK, who have just\nbecome AIDIS members, that many\nsecurity manufacturers may be missing\nout on tax relief due to them for\nresearch and development work.

It featured inputs from Technical\nOpps SOCA, National Tracking, TSU\nManagers, CAST and the ACPO Interoperability programme and the debate was\nlively and interesting.\n\nWhilst this was going inside, the Golf driving\nrange was being transformed with two\ngenerators, and eleven marquees to house\nfifteen exhibitors complete with long range\naudio and optical equipment, a digital\nmapping vehicle and examples of surveillance vehicles. A two years-old Alsatian\nequipped with a wireless body-worn camera\nsystem, proved to be the star of the show. She\nreally did enjoy chewing the golf balls!\n\nThe main challenge to both industry and the\npolice service from 2010 was the issue of\n'Interoperability' and various speakers\nreported that progress was being made thls\nyear although the size and complexity of the\nimplications make it a difficult exercise.\nThe educational entertainment part of the\nevent started with a magic show and talk\nwhich illustrated the practical application of\n'misdirection' in the development of products\nand in their deployment. The theme was\n\nThe aim of the event was to bring a dry\nexhibition to life in an informal environment\nwhere practical demonstrations proved the\nexceptional qualities of the equipment. This\nwas supplemented by training sessions and\nvisitors' equipment assessments. As night fell,\nout came the low light cameras. Whilst the\nsecond day brought a lower footfall, the\nweather held and companies applauded an\nentirely new, interactive and enjoyable event.\n\nm\n\nAnother Parisian success\nT\n\nhe Public Security Event held by AlDlS in\nParis at the beginning of April at the\nhistoric British Ambassador's Residence,\nproved to be even more promising than ever.\n\nThe tabletop exhibition was attended by 29\nmember companies and such was the\ninterest they attracted from key French\nvisitors, that some companies reported\ndoing business on the actual day.\n\"That is previously almost unheard of and\nwe are delighted that the quality of UK\nsecurity technology is clearly continuing to\nbe appreciated by the official agencies of\none of our key European partners,\" said Ray\nLee, the AlDlS Events and Membership\nManager.\n\nwww.adsgroup.org.uk\n\nThis was the fourth time AlDlS had held such\nan event at the Ambassador's Residence\nand the UKTl France Defence and Security\nteam once more played a significant role in\nensuring its customary success. This augurs\nwell for the Milipol Paris Exhibition taking\nplace at Porte de Versailles next October\nwhen AlDlS is responsible for organising the\nlarge UK pavilion there.\nSponsored by the French Ministry of the\nInterior, the event is staged in partnership with\nthe National Police, National Gendarmerie,\nCivil Defence, French Customs, the French\nArmament Procurement Agency (DGA), the\nSCERCAT, the French Air Force Support\nCommand (CSFA) and Europol.\n\nm\n\nNew National Crime Agency\nACPO has welcomed the establishment of the\nnew National Crime Agency which, it says, offers\nthe police an opportunity to raise their game\nagainst some of the most harmful and dangerous\nindividuals in the UK. The ACPO lead on crime,\nChief Constable Jon Murphy, said: 'Organised\ncrime has internationaland national dimensions,\nbut the harm it causes is played out in local\ncommunities and streets in the form of drugrelated crime, gun crime, rabbery, people\ntrafficking and much more.\"\nAnti-hadring centre\nA new cyber security centre has opened in\nGermany to address growing security concerns\nabout the threats posed by hackers to the\ncountry's infrastructure. The security firm, AEP\nNehorks, says cybercrime presents a very real\nthreat to every country's critical infrastructureand\nmore coufitries must follow Germany's example\nand ramp up security measures to protect their\ninfrastructuresagainst cyber warfare in the same\nway they would prepare for any other conflict.\nMore help for ex-offenders\nOffender rehabilitation, skills and employment\nexperts Working Links has officially launched its\njustice division to help deliver the Government's\n'rehabilitation revolution'. Over the last 11 years,\nWorking Links has helped more than 40,000 exoffenders reintegrate back into society by finding\nthem sustainable work and the organisation\ncurrently works in more than 55 prisons across\nGreat Britain.

We have worked to dislocate criminal markets by\nputting criminals behind bars and by destabilising the structures\naround the most important players, and this will be at the heart of the\nNational Crime Agency.\n\nOur host, Commander Peter Sp~ndlerand MichaeI Clayford-Carr Charman of RlSC Council I~stento a\nspeech by Rees Ward, CEO of AlOlS\n\nlaw enforcement nationally had \"woefully underinvested\" against\ncybercrime.\nBusinesses also needed to ensure that their senior management\nteams understood the importance of ensuring they were not\nvulnerable to cyber attack and recognise that it could pose a strategic\nrisk to their activities. A company's defences could be breeched by\nsomething as simple as someone failing to renew their virus software\nsubscription while working from home.\nSir Ian continued: \"It is difficult to know where cyber criminals are\nlocated and most are not susceptible to traditional criminal justice.\nThe National Crime Agency gives us the opportunity to get our law\nenforcement response right - and not a moment too soon.\n\"It is this sort of engagement with the private sector which we need\nto build on over the months and years ahead and this is starting to\n\n\"This offers an outstanding opportunity to provide a step change in\nour response, particularly in the field of cyber. The strategy has\nidentified for the first time something which is amongst the most\nserious threats to the UK and its wellbeing and the Home Office is\ndeveloping a clear performance framework which defines what\nsuccess looks like.\"\nHe added that the Internet had provided criminals with a new arena\nto exploit and there was a new brand of criminals who could develop\ntheir own technology, intrusive software and money laundering tools.\nAt the same time, cyberspace had also enabled ordinary criminals to\nstart operating on a different and more serious level. This meant that\nas well as cyber-based fraud, more traditional crimes were also being\nenabled by the Internet and traditional criminals were becoming\nmore surveillance aware.

During the past 15 years, Bin\nLaden has been the key persona,\nspokesman and visual embodiment of\nAI-Qa'ida. Through his messages on\ntelevision and on the Internet, he\nexpounded the ideology promoting the\nglobal jihad that was developed by both\nhimself and Ayman al-Zawahiri, who has\nsince been named as his successor.\nA vital element of this ideology was to\nmove AI-Qa'ida from being merely a\nphysical group of individuals, who were\ngeographically constrained, into an\nevolving ideology which could inspire\nothers to take up arms against the 'West'\nand strike out globally. Bin Laden realised\nthat this shift to becoming a 'movement'\nwas the key to the success of AI-Qa'ida's\nlong-term goals.\nPrior to the 911 1 attacks, however, the\nAI-Qa'ida core was pivotal to the strength\nof the organisation, around a dozen or so\nmembers of the inner circle surrounded by\nsomething like 100 extremely motivated\nloyalists drawn from around the Muslim\nworld. Below Bin Laden was his deputy\nAbu Ayoub al-Iraqi, otherwise known as\nMamdouth Salim, and underneath him\nwere the consultative committee drawn\nfrom Mujahedeen who fought in the Soviet-\n\n16 Issue 54 PUBLIC SECURITY\n\n:\n\n.. *=S\n>\n;,;\n\n.\n\n\n-.: 3yf\"\"::'\n\n...\n\n'\n\nKa:iy*r,lf5\n.-..,\n... 7\n:j;s\n'\"4'\n\n,\n\nAfghan war in the 1970s/80s and who had\nsworn a pledge of allegiance to Bin Laden\nin 1989.\nSince their forced withdrawal from\nAfghanistan, the members of the core\nleadership hid themselves away within the\ntribal regions of Waziristan, scattered over\nboth the Pakistani and Afghani sides of the\nborder. Due to the ferocious nature of the\nAllied Forces' pursuit, the core of AI-Qa'ida\nbecame increasingly small in numbers, yet\nretained an incredibly tight knit structure.\nDespite the denial of territorial space for\nAI-Qa'ida by increased NATO operations in\nAfghanistan since 2005, the small number\nof operatives had been strengthened\nsomewhat by the relationships it had formed\nwith Pashtun extremists and separatist\ngroups which live in the border regions.\nThousands of Arab jihadis had made their\nhomes in this region, with many marrying the\nPashtun widows of Taliban fighters, and that\nhas ensured their continued protection and\nthe loyalty of the local tribes. And this is\nwhere it was assumed for many years that\nBin Laden was hiding, so it came as a\nsurprise to many that he was discovered in a\nsecure house less than a mile from Pakistan's\nmain military academy in Abbottabad.\nThis raises a serious question mark over\nthe potential involvement of Pakistani\nMilitary and Intelligence services in Bin\nLaden's hide out. Even though Zardari's\nadministration had ramped up their efforts\nto counter the Taliban and AI-Qa'ida, the\ninfluence of the Pakistani intelligence\nservices, the ISI, is still undeniably strong.\nWithin the IS1 there remains a reluctance\namong some members to fight what they\n\n&;\nh , .#i?i.\n.\nh-11,\n',\na<\n\n: =\n\n.-\n\n. : g .\n\n~.\n- --\n\n.:F:,--\n\nl\n\n... \".F;\n\n&.,!m\n\n~~\n\nhe death of Osama Bin Laden\nrepresents the closure of the first\nchapter in the story of the battle\nagainst AI-Qa'ida, but his supporters will\nultimately regroup and react to his cult of\nmartydom and open the next chapter.\n\n.\n\n,\n\n>\n\n.:.\n\n~\n\n,\n\n-\n\n.\n\nsee as fellow Muslims. The IS1 have\ntraditionally been blamed for a great deal\nof support for violent Islamic groups in its\nfractious relationship with India:\n\"The ISl's sphere of influence extends\nbeyond its national borders; militant groups\nseeking to undermine the administration in\nKashmir were reputedly established by the\nIS1 and trained by Pakistani Army, and\nIslamist groups within India are actively\nencouraged by the organisation. Much of\nthe region's chaos can be blamed on the\nISl's meddling and manipulation, but it is too\nlate to put the genie back in the bottle.\"l\nHowever, this raises even more serious\nquestions about the extent to which IS1\nmembers were involved in the hiding of Bin\nLaden, and the repercussions of evidence\nfound to further support this line will be\nhighly damaging for Pakistan. That the US\noperation to kill Bin Laden involved no\nPakistan forces and the Pakistani\ngovernment had not been informed about\nthe attack, would indicate that their\ninvolvement was a risk not worth taking,\ndespite the serious implications this could\nhave had if the operation had failed.\n\nThe Changing Shape of AI-Qa'ida\nThro~\n~ g h o uthe\nt 2000s, AI-Qa'ida's global\npresence and impact have dramatically\nwidened as the organisation transformed\ninto a network of loosely affiliated\nfranchises operating more or less\nindependently of a leadership on the run.\nAI-Qa'ida's ideology, long-term strategy,\ntraining materials and justification of jihad\nare freely available on the Internet,\nenabling any independent cell or group to\noperate within its framework. There is no\nlonger as much of a reliance on a\ncentralised base, which was enjoyed in\nAfghanistan, and few of the terrorists have\nany form of personal contact with the inner\ncore of leaders.\nBin Laden's final resting spot exemplified\nthe difficulty he was having in providing the\nmessages to those he wished to influence.\n\nwww.adsgroup.org.uk\n\n,\n\nL\n\n5'\n\nL\":.:F:\n:\n\nI\n\n\fhave all demonstrated the influence that\nal-Awlaki and his group now have on\ntaking the global jihad into the 2010% more\nso than the AI-Qa'ida 'core'.\nThe long-term aims of AI-Qa'ida remain\ndespite Bin Laden's demise, and his\ninfluence as a martyr will continue to grow\nin the months and years to come as will the\nglorification of his death being leapt upon\nby both sides. There is no doubting that\nthe death of Bin Laden is the closure of the\nfirst chapter of the story of and battle\nagainst AI-Qa'ida, and that this will slow\nthe momentum of the organisation.\nThis is something which should be greeted\nhappily as a partial victory in the ongoing\nstruggle against international terrorism.\nHowever, the ideological message and\ninfluence of Bin Laden has clearly been\nglobally dispersed and the weeks and\nmonths ahead will demonstrate how the\nvarious factions and offshoots of AI-Qa'ida\nwill regroup and ultimately react to the\ndeath of Bin Laden and open the next\nchapter of the story.\n\nReference\nl .

The capabilities of today's\naverage phone include high quality camera, audio and video\ncapabilities,email and SMS communicationsas well as the capacity to\nstore a huge amount of data. The mobile phone has become an Ideal\naccessory for illicit activity providing an excellent repository and tool\nto capture photos or record information.\nUnsurprisingly, this has made it a major component in criminal\nand anti-terror investigations. A vast wealth of information or\nevidence can be found on mobile phones: pictures, phonebooks,\ntext messages, call history and video movies. This can supply\ncritical information for investigators, holding in many cases the\nsecret to unlocking the movements, activities and contacts of\nindividuals and placing suspects at the scene of crime at a given\ntime and date, thereby forming an empirical basis for criminal\nprosecution or defence.\nThe huge diversity of different handsets, vendors and models on the\nmarket can make the task of extracting mobile data a difficult one. It\nstarts with being able to find the right data cable to access the\nphone's data or to power up the phone. This simple challenge is just\nthe first of many reasons why collecting mobile forensic evidence in\nthe field has been a hit and miss affair and the viability of the\nresultant information in standing up to courtroom scrutiny has been\npatchy at best. However, new technological developments, with\nsolutions like Cellebrite's UFED (Universal Forensic Extraction\nDevice), have revolutionised the speed and ease with which mobile\ndevices, smart phones and PDAs can be forensically analysed. This\nis also the reason why these new devices, which can be operated in\nthe field without the need for expert assistance, are being deployed\nin numerous local and national police forces, anti-terrorist and\npublic security units worldwide.\n\n26 Issue 54 PUBLIC SECURITY\n\nApproaches to retrieving mobile phone evidence in the field in the\npast have been fraught with difficulty Some approaches involved\ntrying to capture images of individual mobile screens to present as\nevidence. The diversity of phones on the market meant that it was\nalso practically impossible for police to successfully find the necessary\nevidence. Even if the police team were able to overcome the difficulty\nof the wide range of cables needed and the knowledge of how to use\neach device, there was always the added complexity of retrieving\ndeleted information or accessing password protected data.\nThe most commonly used tools available in the past have been\nSIM card readers or PC-based tools provided by individual phone\nmanufacturers and used in the laboratories, but these were\nrestricted to only accessing contact details and some call history\nheld on the SIM. As phones have become more sophisticated and\nthe array of information stored on them has expanded, these tools\nbecame only a partial solution. What's more, the fact that they\nwere only accessible in a lab environment meant that the phone\nmust be confiscated and brought in as evidence, which was not\nalways easy to achieve.\nAnother major challenge has been the problem of retrieving deleted\ninformation. Whist extracting information from PC hard disks has\nbecome a relatively easy exercise for police at a crime scene,\ninformation wiped from a mobile phone's memory can be almost\nimpossible to recover, according to Tyler Moore, a researcher at the\nUniversity of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.\nWhen a user tries to delete data on a PC, the information is not actually\nremoved. Instead, the pointers to the data are deleted, but\n\nwww.adsgroup.org.uk\n\nI 1\n\n\f8\n\n\">TKqp?a7r\n\n\\?-\n\ne s l d ' ~ . ~ o .\nmarket means that information is stored and handled in non-s\n\nthe capture of the perpeaators of a crime.\n\n' ways making the task of retrieving it considerably harder. It is pleasing\nthat technology is moving forward and solutions like the UFED are\nnow able to retrieve all the visible evidence like photos, call histories,\nphone books, calendar, videos, audio, text messages, call logs from\naround 1,700 different devices including Symbian, Windows Mobile,\niPhone, Blackberry and Palm OS devices. Recent advances have even\nmade ~tposslble to place a suspect at the crime scene by identlfylng\nthe cell address from whlch the phone was reg~stered. Deeper data\nextraction is made possible using what's known as a memory hex\ndump to access the phone file system mcluding deleted data and\nphone passwords. Visible and deleted data IS presented in a clear\nconase report suitable for use as legal endence in court.\n\nAlready this new technology has helped to tracE down criminals\naround the globe. The Belgian police have used the UFED device to\nhelp secure prosecutions for paedophile gangs. The same devices are\nalso being used extensively by West Yorkshire Police Force in their\ndaily pollce work. In cases of illegal gambling where the phones\nthemselves have been the medium by which the bets have been\nplaced over SMS texts, the evidence produced using these devices has\nhelped secure numerous convictions. Many cyber-cnme government\nagencies worldwide have also recognised the technological merits of\nthese new mobile forensic devices and added them to their list of\ncrime-fighting tools.\n\nAnother key frustration with compiling and presenting mobile\nforensic evidence in court led to two specific issues which have\nchallenged police forces. The first was the need to retain the\ninformation on the device exactly as it was found at the crime scene\nand the second challenge has been to present the mobile forensic\nreports in a format which is clear and unequivocal and can easily be\nunderstood by judge and jury Retaining the mobile evidence in its\noriginal format requires the use of a Faraday bag to disconnect the\nphone from the network and ensure that no incoming calls tamper\nwith the evidence. Mobile forensic evidence must also be\naccompanied by an MD5 signature to prove the integrity of the\nevidence has not been tampered with and solutions like the UFED\nhave to comply with these requirements.\n\nIt means that regular police officers, without any technical skills or\nforensic training, can now extract scene-of-crime information saving\nboth time and money This greater ability to extract data, including\ndeleted data, has opened up even greater opportunities in fighting\ncrime. The huge number and diversity of mobile phones in use has\nlong been a barrier to solving the challenge of retrieving deleted data\nand few vendors are able to keep pace with the phenomenal rate at\nwhich new makes and models are introduced to the market.\nThe potential for these latest new technological innovations in being\nable to retrieve vital information wthin minutes at the crime scene,\nrepresents a major step forward m helping police forces, anti-terrorist\nand military and intelligence agencies globally to fight crime.\n\nm\nPerhaps the biggest step forward in technology has been the ability to\nuse mobile forensic extraction devices in the field as well as in the lab.\nThis means that the integrity of data IS more easily protected as the\ndata can be collected by the scene-of-crime officer who simply\nattaches the mobile device to the mobile forensic system and extracts\nthe information onto a USB drive.

The\ncountry is easy to reach - several direct daily flights operate from\nSofia to London airports and there are two flights per week to\nManchester with flight time being about three hours. People are\nfriendly and English is widely spoken in business circles, particularly\nby the younger generation.\nThe country plays an important role in strengthening co-operation in\nthe area of security in the Balkans. It strives to endorse the leading\nrole of NATO and the EU in the stabilization of the region on its way\nto integration and economic development. Bulgaria is actively\nsupporting the upcoming European accession processes of the\nWestern Balkan countries and is aligning its strategic security policies\nwith Greece and Romania. UK companies looking to base business in\nBulgaria may simultaneously benefit from a larger market area with\nincreasing security needs.\nSince 2007, Bulgaria has been a full member of the European Union\nand s o has become an external border for the EU. The country is bent\non fulfilling all technical requirements as regards its expected\nSchengen accession (provisionally scheduled for 2012) and aims to\nkeep all borders up to high standard. The measures for implementation of common standards o n control and surveillance of EU's\nexternal borders are both EU funded and backed by the state budget.\nNonetheless, further investments are required to support counterterrorism measures and fight against drug and human trafficking.\nSOCA's office at the British Embassy in Sofia has been working in\nclose co-operation with its Bulgarian partners over the past 10 years\non tackling the threats from serious and organised crime.\nThe Bulgarian Ministry of Interior together with the Ministry of\nFinance, the Customs Agency and Border Police are looking for ways\nto improve border monitoring, security and customs database\nsystems. Three helicopters worth Eur 15 million have recently been\npurchased from Agusta Westland. Bulgarian ports, airports and train\nstations are being constantly equipped with the latest generation\n\nissue 34 PUBLIC SECURITY\n\nCC\" systems/ IP surveillance systems, detection scanners, access\ncontrol and fire detection systems, ID security. application\n-equipment, etc. The first biometrical ID documents were issued in\nApril 2011 under a joint project with Siemens.\n\nBulgaria is placing increased efforts into strengthening the rule of law.\nSince the GEDB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria)\nGovernment came to power in mid-2008, there has been increased\npolitical will to address illegality and reform the judiciary system.\nContract killings and kidnapping have become less frequent and the\nPolice are managing to exert greater pressure on mafia groups and raise\nthe efficiency in fighting conventional crime. Nevertheless, there is still\nmuch to do and the provision of sophisticated forensic and field testing\nequipment is largely perceived as a must these days.\nA recently adopted Programme for Improvement of Prison Conditions\naims at improving the living conditions and lifestyle in prisons and\nbringing them in line with international standards. Bulgaria remains\nthe only country in the EU which has not built a single prison in 50\nyears. The construction of a new prison in Sofia is expected to begin\nin 2012-2013, specific measures for reconstruction and rehabilitation\nof the existing prisons have also been mapped out. The implementation of this programme requires a minimum of € 10 million to be\nprovided through Justice Ministry's budget. Money will also be sought\nfrom EU operational programmes and in PPP schemes.\nThe cities o f Sofia and Varna have completed projects for videosurveillance in the central areas and certain sensitive zones, including\ntraffic safety and public safety The Municipality of Varna, Bulgaria's\nlargest Black Sea port, set up a joint-venture with the Austrian Efkon\nto purchase and install cameras. The central area of Sofia is already\nunder video-monitoring and the project will be extended to public\nschools, kindergartens and city entrance points. Other cities are\nconsidering installation of remote control and information systems,\nincluding monitoring of the traffic lights, street lights and flood\ncontrol. A nation-wide vehicle counting/ monitoring system is\nexpected to b e introduced by the Road Infrastructure Agency.\nThe growth in the local security and safety sector is determined by\nthe completion of large infrastructure projects (incl. nuclear facilities\nand transnational gas pipel~nes), agents, banking, retail and\ncommercial projects and, until recently, real estate deals. There is a\ngrowing demand for access control, perimeter security and videosurveillance equipment at modern office buildings, trade and\nentertainment centres and tourist/ recreational complexes. (Bulgaria\nis in the league of Europe's top six currently most popular tourist\ndestinations ). Many private companies in the big cities offer real-time\nmonitoring of premises and physical control and the number of\nclients using this technology is on the rise.\n\nwww.adsgroup.org.uk\n\n\fThe private security sector covers over 1,000 licensed companies\nincluding guard/ personal security providers and surveillance\nagencies. These are mostly small and medium-sized firms who\nacquire equipment from established local importers and re-sellers.\nThe leading 50-60 firms offer a range of activities, i.e. engineering,\nproject design, delivery and maintenance of equipment, physical\nsecurity/patrolling, etc. They also act as representatives or agents of\nmajor international suppliers of security equipment and products. As\nof last year, foreign physical security service providers are allowed to\noperate in the Bulgarian market.\nThe Bulgarian Army continues its movement towards full\nprofessionalization and modernisation (Bulgaria has been a NATO\nmember since 2004). The current level of military spending (1.5% of\nGDP) is likely to be maintained over the next few years. The focus of\ngovernment spending will be on high-tech equipment. Several\nmonths ago, the government adopted a 10-year Defence Strategy\nproviding for the implementation of a dozen priority projects until\n2020. The envisaged amount of funds exceeds Eur 1 billion and\ncovers activities such as:\npurchase of new multipurpose fighter jets;\nextending the life of MIG fighter jets;\nmodernisation of Bulgarian navy navigation system;\ndevelopment of a technical system for strategic surveillance;\ncompleting the creation of special operation forces;\ndevelopment of a \"Cyber Defence\" project.\n\nDefence/ Ministry of Interior may approach suppliers directly and\nhold subsequent negotiations. Offset contracts are awarded\nfollowing a negotiation procedure with the Ministry of Economy,\nEnergy and Tourism.\nThe best way to enter the Bulgarian market for commercial/\nindustrial security products is to appoint a local agent/distributor.\nIt is not essential to choose an exclusive distributor although\nsuccessful deals might presuppose exactly that type of\npartnership. When bidding for tender-based projects, it is\nadvisable to enter into a working relationship with a local\nbusiness partner who would be able to keep in touch with key\ndecision makers and provide local knowledge including language\nand logistical support.\nUK security equipment is perceived to be of fairly high-quality,\nbut not always price-competitive. Names such as BM, Agusta\nWestland, G4S, Smiths Detection and De La Rue are well known\nin Bulgaria. In 2009, Land Rover won a tender for delivery of\narmoured vehicles to the Bulgarian Police. UK Trade and\nInvestment Sofia can be of help to UK exporters as a door-opener\nto key government agencies and decision makers. The UIC'T&I\nteam is committed to provide advice and support to UK\ncompanies willing to locate business partners, enter the\nBulgarian market or expand their business presence.\n\nThe priority projects are subject to approval by Parliament (worth\nover Eur 50 m), by the Cabinet (Eur 25-50 m); and by the\nDefence Minister (below Eur 25 m).\nSecurity and defence- related projects are funded with EU money,\nWorld Bank loans (railway transport modernisation), international donor programmes (US, Norway, Netherlands). The\nregulatory basis for the establishment of public/private\npartnerships is currently being developed. Business is conducted\nbasically through competitive bidding as per Bulgaria's public\nprocurement legislation. The latter is largely harmonised with EU\nprocurement rules.

It enables\nauthorised police officers and staff to access\nnational police databases securely using one\nunique password or smartcard and pin.\n\nnew online procurement process\nbeing rolled out to forces across the\ncountry by the NPIA, is set to save the\npolice service up to S30 million during the\nnext six years by streamlining the\nprocurement process.\nThe National Police Procurement Hub is an\n'Amazon-style\" electronic marketplace that\nprovides the police service with the ability to\nbuy goods and services from approved\ncontracts. It links purchase to payment, without having to use paper orders and invoices.\n\nThe NPIA negotiated a deal with Siemens\nEnterprise Communications,so forces could\nbuy equipment at a reduced cost. Using the\nframework to set up IAM saves each force on\naverage around &150,000.\nThe system also creates a common security\nplatform for secure information sharing\nbetween forces meaning they will be ready to\nmake full use of the Police National\nDatabase. Plans are also being made to use\nIAM for other national applications such as\nIDENTl (the national fingerprint database)\nand development work is well underway\nwith CRASH (a computerised accident\nrecording system).\n\nAlthough some forces use an electronic\nprocess for part of the procurement process,\nthere is no other system that allows forces to\ndo the whole process of ordering, buying,\ninvoicing and paying online.\nThis new initiative is being delivered by the\nNPIA, endorsed by ACPO and is due to be\ncompleted nationwide by June 2012.\nIn addition to saving money, the system also:\n\nenables SMEs (small medium enterprises)\nand other suppliers to work more\nefficiently with the police service;\nmakes the procurement process more\nefficient by enabling forces to buy\ntogether and reduce costs;\nsaves forces time on mariaging their own\nprocurement process;\nprovides forces with easy access to best\nvalue contract.\nSue Moffatt, Head of Commercial and\nProcurement at the NPIA, said: \"The Hub\n\nwww.adsgroup.org.uk\n\ncomplements\nexisting\nprocurement\nprocesses across the police service so\nforces do not need to invest in replacing\ncurrent systems. It enhances existing\nprocesses and provides a simple online\nshopping system to access best value\nproducts and services.\"\n\nIAM also delivers authentication of\nindividuals accessing police systems, access\nfor officers to police systems from any\nlocation and single sign-on which avoids\nmultiple log-in processes for individual\nsystems and password resetting.\n\nDavid Horne, the project's Senior\nResponsible Officer, and Chair of ACPO's\nProcurement Portfolio said: \"This is a big\nstep forward in enabling police procurement\nto deliver yet more savings, as well as better\nsupport for the service's operational\nrequirements. It will also ensure greater\nconvergence with our suppliers.\"\n\nNPIA programme manager for IAM,Graham\nDunn, said: \"Public safety and value for\nmoney are the overriding objectives for the\nNPIA and police forces.\nThe IAM\nprogramme is providing the technology that\nwill lead to better sharing of information for\nfrontline policing with organisation-wide\ncost and procurement efficiencies.\"\n\nm\n\nm\nPUBLIC SECURITY Issue 54 33\n\n\fThe all-new 2011 Directory\nfeatures:\nACPO's\nUpdated phone\nnumbers\nV\nAccurate email\naddresses\nStaff changes\nacross the sector\nOrganisational\nchanges\nHQ force\nnumbers\nACPO and\nACPOS forces\nNational forces\nand agencies\nAirports, ports, waterways police\nGovernment agencies\nCriminal courts\nPrisons\nTrading Standards\n\nofficial\ndirectoryof\nUK polidng\n\nI\n\nCambridge Consultants Ltd\nPhone: +44 (0) 1223 420024\nE: info@cambridgeconsultants.com\nW.C\nidgeconsultankcm\n\nGCGlobal Communications\nnhone: +M(0) 1454 61005\"\n\ncontactr&\nreswrces\n\nPOUCE\n\n-hone: +44 (0) 1914 193777\n\n'hone: +44 (0) 1217 81440-\n\nDIRECTORY 2011\nI DED Limited\n\nI The Mercian Labels Group\n+44 (0) 1543 431070\nmall: sales@mercianlabels.com\nw.mercianlabels.com\n\n'hone: +44 (0) 1797 320636\nmail: dedsales@ded.co.uk\nvww.ded.co.uk\n\nI Peli Products (UK) Ltd\n'hone +44 (0) 1457 869%\nFax: +44 (0) 1457 869966\n\nhone +44 (0) 1689 860757\n\nI\n\nPhone. + 44 (0)1245468 716\nEmall sales@digitaltf.net\n\nORDER YOUR COPY NOW\nwww.policingtoday.co.uk\nor telephone +44 (0)1243576444\n\nc\nTO ADVERTISE ON THIS PAGE Contact: Danielle Robinson\n\nIs dynamic entry\ntraining & operations\nblowing a hole in\nyour budget?\nConsider the mos\nadaptable, reloadable a$$\ncost effective diversiona~\nproducts in the world\n\na\n\nc-\n\nthomaslowedefence.com\ninfo@thomaslowedefence.com\n\n34 Issue 54 PUBLIC SECURITY\n\n//\n\ntel: (+U)\n02082 426696\n\nwww.adsgroup.org.uk\n\n\fMlLlPOL PARIS\nWorldwide exhibition\nof internal State security\n18-21 October 2011\nParis Porte de Versailles\" .Pavilion 1\n\nGlobal Security :\nm\n\nVeet your privileged international contacts\nDiscover product and service innovations\n\nPUBSEC\n\n\f--- - -- m - I ;plc\nQ-I- m\n\nL\n\nAdvanced Asset Protection\n\n8 25 million items marked.\n6S e l e c t a m\n@ Used by over 30 policeforces selectat*qeF.W\nb Used in over 10\nB.\n8CM~,.\nAdvanced Forenac Marlong\n\nl\n\n................................. ..............,... *..-..........\n\n*\n\nPermanent Vis~bleMa5tng\n\nP\n\nm\n\n,\n\n,\n\n--Au---\n\nThe Origtnal HandbagClip\n\nVisit www.selectaDNA.co.uk and www.selectamarkco.uk\nor call us on 01689 860757 to find out more.\n\n\f",

The\nunique nature of this event is mirrored by the partnership between CAST and\nthe organisers, ADS. ADS is a non-profit making trade organisation dedicated\nto supporting UK industry supplying the public security sector worldwide. This\npartnership continues to be enhanced for 2012 by the support of UK Trade and\nInvestment Defence and Security Organisation (UKTI DSO) who will be taking the\nlead on formal overseas delegation management.\nIn this Olympic year, the spotlight is on the UK to deliver what will be a magnificent\nsporting event that the nation and the world will be proud of.

In addition, we are able to facilitate the\nassistance of other parts of the British Government, with the provision of advice\non equipment capability, operational use, and training.\nI would particularly like to welcome our overseas guests to this event. At this\nexhibition you will see a broad selection of leading British companies supplying\nequipment and services in the key areas of Crime and Policing, Security and\nCounter Terrorism, and Border Security. You will also be able to hear from UK\nGovernment experts on a range of policing and security-related issues, and who\nwill be available to speak with you should you wish to discuss other issues.\nI hope you will find your stay in the UK both enjoyable and informative. My staff\nand I are ready to assist you.\n\nRichard Paniguian CBE\nHead of the UKTrade & Investment Defence & Security Organisation\n\nI\n\n\f\fADS - the UK's Aerospace, Defence and\nSecllrity trade organisation\n\n7I\n\nADS is the trade organisation advancing UK Aerospace, Defence and\nSecurity industries, with Farnborough International Limited as a whollyowned subsidiary. ADS, with over 900 Members and together with its\nregional partners, represents over 3,000 companies across the UK. It\nsupports international business development for SMEs through its own\noffices in Toulouse, Delhi and Bangalore, and through MOUs with trade\norganisations in 20 export markets, including the USA and Japan.\n\nThe role of ADS in the Security sector is to serve UK companies, large and\nsmall, which manufacture goods and supply services to public Security agencies worldwide. These\ninclude police, prisons, fire, customs, immigration, government Security, anti-crime, cyber Security and\ncounter terrorist organisations.\nThis year, ADS produced its first Security survey of its Membership, which reveals that the UK has\na thriving and growing Security industry with a rapidly growing five per cent global market share. It\nalso shows that, in many parts of the world, the prospects for the UK Security industry are particularly\nencouraging, as I am sure you will agree having seen the many exhibits at Security & Policing 2012.\nThe last few years have witnessed a serious ramping up of counter terrorism efforts by global\ngovernments, as well as the increasing need for public Security agencies to be supported with\nintelligent, sophisticated, high quality and reliable technologies and equipment.\nH M Government and the Home Office recognise the fundamental roles that the Security industry, the\npolice and other agencies play together in a partnership to drive forward innovation and cutting-edge\ndevelopments in the fight against crime and the provision of National Resilience.\nThe Security & Policing exhibition is the UKS premier platform for showcasing world leading\ntechnologies and solutions for law enforcement and public Security applications.

Many parts of the GMR standard are\nderived from the GSM standard.\nThree satellite systems run GMR-based radiocommunications systems: Thuraya, ACeS (Asia Cellular Satellite System) and ISAT. Thuraya is based on the GMR-1 standard,\nwhich is not discussed in this document. For more information about the Thuraya system, refer to the ARPEGE\nEDITHTTHERESEIMARTHE product brochure. ACeS and\nISAT are based on the GMR-2 standard.\nACeS is a company headquartered in Indonesia and operates one satellite (Garuda-l). The coverage area includes\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, India and\nparts of Pakistan. In 2006, ACeS entered into a collaboration\nagreement with INMARSAT, a satellite telecommunications\ncompany based in Great Britain. INMARSAT runs the ISAT\nmobile radio system and operates three 4th generation satellites (1-4 EMEA, 1-4 APAC, 1-4 Americas), which provide\nGMR-2 service. Currently, 1-4 EMEA and 1-4 APAC provide\nISAT service in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe.\nThe GMR-2 system enables voice, fax and data communications. Voice traffic accounts for the largest part of all\nGMR-2 communications.\n\nGMR-2 coverane areas\n\nGMR-2 mobile phones are only slightly larger than conventional GSM mobile phones. GMR-2 mobile phones operate\nin dual mode: If a GSM network is available, it is used to\nset up a call; otherwise, a call is established via a GMR-2\nsatellite. However, subscribers can force a connection via\nsatellite even if a GSM network is available.\nThe geosynchronous satellites provide coverage for mobile\ncommunications via a large number of spot beams. Communications within a spot beam take place in the L band.\nCommunications between the satellite and the gateway\nstations take place in the C band in the global beam\nand can thus be monitored from any location within the\nGMR-2 satellite's footprint area.\n\nAspects of radiomonitoring\nSimilar as in GSM networks, the traffic channels and\nmost signaling channels are encrypted in the GMR-2\nsystem. For contents analysis, captured traffic needs to be\ndecoded first.\nARPEGE ISIS-4G monitors communications in the C band\nfrom any location within the GMR-2 satellite's footprint\narea.\nARPEGE IRIS-4G and ARPEGE IRMA-4G capture\ntraffic channels (voice, fax, data) and identifying call\ncharacteristics.\n\n\fm\n..\n,\n\nl\n\n\\ C/L band\n\nMonitoring range\nSimilar to the terrestrial GSM, the GMR-2 system uses the\nsame radlo frequencies in different spot beams (frequency\nreuse). As an inherent feature of the GMR-2 system, twoway interception of traffic channels is possible only in a\nlimited number of spot beams around the site of the monitoring system. Two-way Interception means the reception\nand processing of the incoming (forward link) and outgoing (return link) radio signals (each from the perspective of the GMR-2 subscriber). The two-way intercept~on\nrange depends on the areas covered by the spot beams\nand on the distance between spot beams using the same\nfrequency and timeslots. Outside the two-way interception\nrange, a central station (ARPEGE IRIS4G) intercepts and\nprocesses the return links (outgoing voice, fax and data)\nfor a speclflc number of spot beam areas. Remote L band\nsensors (ARPEGE IRMA4G) intercept the forward link on\nsite, thus expanding the two-way Interception range of the\nmonitoring system.\nAs a basic rule, duplex communications can be intercepted in the spot beam in which the monitoring system is\nlocated. Plus, duplex communications can be intercepted\nIn some spot beams adjacent to the center spot beam\ndepending on the allocation of frequencies and tlmeslots.\n\nARpEGElRMA4G\n\nThe flgure on the lower left shows as an example the\ncoverage provided by a Korean-based ARPEGE IRIS4G\n\nl\n\nI\n\nsystem.\nNeighboring spot beam clusters can use the same frequencies without interfering with one another. Spot beams\nthat use the same frequency can be successfully intercepted by one monitoring station due to the use of different timeslots. Typically, the spot beams in question differ\nin signal power. The stronger signal will be intercepted; the\nweaker signal will be lost.\n\n\nTwo-way interception range of a Korean-based\nARPEGE IRIS4G svstem\n\n'\n\nA preliminary site survey is recommended in order to\nmeasure the actual coverage provided by the relevant\nspot beams (spot beam visibility). This, in turn, will help to\ndetermine the monitoring coverage provided by ARPEGE\n\nARPEGE ISIS-4GIIRIS-4GIIRMA-4GSatellite Monitoring System 5\n\n\fARPEGE ISIS-4G -\n\nPrinciple of operation\nEach activity of a mobile phone in the GMR-2 system\nstarts with some bursts that are transmitted over the\nstandalone dedicated control channel (SDCCH).This feature has been adopted from the GSM standard, though\nthe GMR-2 SDCCH burst's structure is different from that\nof the corresponding GSM burst.\n\ndetermining GMR-2\nactivities and\nidentifying areas of\ninterest\n\nAn SDCCH channel is established for each traffic channel in a spot beam for one of the following reasons, for\nexample:\nI The subscriber initiates a call (mobile-originated call)\nI The subscriber accepts a call (mobile-terminated call)\nI For technical reasons (location update, etc.), without any\nactivity on the part of the subscriber\nSDCCH bursts are transmitted from the mobile phone to\nthe satellite in the L band. Signal interception takes place\nin the C band, i.e. in the downlink from the satellite to the\ngateway station.\nIt must be taken into account, however, that there is no\nfixed mapping of the traffic channel of a spot beam in\nthe L band uplink to frequencies in the C band downlink.\nInstead, frequency mapping may be changed without\nnotice. For the monitoring system, this means that all\nSDCCH channels of the GMR-2 satellite system have to be\nintercepted simultaneously, even if the area of interest may\nbe limited.\n\nOperating principle of the ARPEGE ISIS-4G\nsatellite monitoring system\n\n,\n\nThe required monitoring bandwidth may vary depending on the type of satellite being monitored (ACeS or\nINMARSAT). ARPEGE ISIS4G provides full-band activity\ndetection for ACeS monitoring. For GMR-2 activities over\nINMARSAT satellites, which operate in a wlder frequency\nrange, ARPEGE ISIS4G needs to be expanded to provide\nfull-band activity detection (ARPEGE ISIS-4G + ARPEGE\nISIS-4G-X).\nARPEGE ISIS4G receives the GMR-2 s~gnalfrom a tracking parabolic antenna for the C band that converts the signal t o the L band.

The GMR-2 frequency\nband is downconverted by means of multiple downconverters. The required number of downconverters and corresponding processing units depends on the type of satellite being monitored (ACeS or INMARSAT).\n\nThe signals are digitized and searched in realtime for\nSDCCH bursts. Detected bursts are marked and transferred\nto one of the SDCCH burst analyzers.\n\nThe required antenna size depends on the location of the\nARPEGE ISIS4G monitoring system. Antenna diameters in\nthe order of seven to nine meters are appropriate.\n\nA result data record is generated for each access of a\nmobile phone t o the GMR-2 system. The data record\nessentially contains the following information:\nI Timestamp\nI Spot beam ID\nI Reason for activity (e.g. mobile-originated call,\nresponse to paging, location update)\nI Power class of mobile phone\nI lMSl of satellite terminal (SIM card)\n\nAfter conversion to the L band, the signals are transmitted to the building that houses the central station of the\nmonitoring system. Long distances of more than 100 m\nbetween the antenna and this building can be bridged by\nusing fiber-optic cables.\nThe described system configuration is dimensioned to\nmonitor signals from one satellite. To monitor several\nGMR-2 satellites simultaneously, multiple sets of equipment must be used.\n\nThe SDCCH analyzer demodulates and decodes the\nburst information. The results obtained are stored as data\nrecords in a database on the server.\n\nTo visualize and analyze the stored data records, we\nrecommend that you use the ARPEGE monitoring center\n(see page 15).\n\nAnalys~sand stat~sticsworkstation\n\nARPEGE ISIS-4G/IRIS-4G/IRMA-4G Satellite Monitoring System 7\n\n\fARPEGE IRIS-4G/\nARPEGE IRMA-4G monitoring GMR-2\ncontents\nInterception of\nduplex traffic with a\ncentral station\n\nPrinciple of operation\nARPEGE IRIS4G is an expansion of ARPEGE ISIS-4G.\nSome components of ARPEGE IRIS4G require data from\nARPEGE ISIS4G. The ARPEGE IRIS-4G modules operate on the following principle: They monitor the downlink\ntransmissions from the satellite in the C band and in the L\nband. In the L band, the system receives the forward link\n(from the gateway station to the mobile phone); in the C\nband, it receives the return link (from the mobile phone t o\nthe gateway station).\nIn the L band, the mapping of frequencies to the spot\nbeam footprints is stable. In the C band, by contrast, the\nfrequency mapping may change. Based on the results obtained with ARPEGE ISIS-4G, the current frequency mapping is automatically determined. The resulting pairs of frequencies are integrated into the processing chain through\ndigital subband selection.\nThe term \"frequency mapping\" designates the relationship between the L band uplink frequency and the C band\ndownlink frequency for each channel. The frequency\nmapping can be changed by the network operator. The\nwideband concept of ARPEGE ISIS4G ensures that\nany changes in frequency mapping will be immediately\ndetected ' J .\n\n-~\n\nOperating principle of the AKPttit lKlS-4ti\ncatellite monitoring\n\nSystem structure\nThe figure on the next page (bottom) is a block diagram of\nan ARPEGE ISIS-4GlARPEGE IRIS4G satellite monitoring\nsystem.

It extracts the contents from the\nC band signal, allowing the return link contents of any spot\nbeam to be analyzed. It is thus possible to collect missionrelevant information immediately, i.e. without - or before\n- installing a semi-mobile or fixed L band sensor in the\ntarget area.\nThe system operator assigns C-band-only processing\nresources (SBUs) to spot beams of interest. Subband units\nin C-band-only mode make it possible to intercept contents and to locate GMR-2 subscribers with spot beam\naccuracy. Missions to be performed as part of new operations can, therefore, be promptly accomplished.\nThe figure below illustrates mission planning for ARPEGE\nIRIS-4G (including ARPEGE IRIS-CON). The red spot beam\nfootprints are located near the central station, and the associated subbands are processed by subband units in\ntwo-way mode. The blue spot beam footprints are located\nin remote regions, and the associated subbands are processed by further subband units at the central station in\nC-band-only mode.\n\n(re$: dualex. blue: simdex.

The remote sensor station\n(ARPEGE IRMA-4G) is connected to the central station\n(ARPEGE IRIS-4G) via a wide area network (WAN), and is\nremote-controlled from the central station.\n\nSystem structure\nThe figure below shows an ARPEGE ISIS-4GlARPEGE\nIRIS-4G central station that intercepts GMR-2 duplex contents by means of an ARPEGE IRMA4G remote sensor.\nFor two-way interception of voice channels, the hardware\nfor traffic channel and signaling channel processing must\nbe distributed symmetrically at the central station and\nthe remote site. In other words, there must be an equal\nnumber of subband processing units (ARPEGE IRIS-SBUI\nARPEGE IRMA-SBU) provided at the central station and at\nthe remote site. This is necessary to ensure that an equal\npool of resources is available to capture the forward and\nthe return link of a voice connection.\nThe remote satellite monitoring system contains the\nfollowing components:\nI Fixed L band antenna at remote site (ARPEGE IM-AL)\nI Subband selection unit for C band signals at central\nstation (included in ARPEGE IRIS-4G)\nI Subband selection unit for L band signals at site of\nremote sensor (included in ARPEGE IRMA4G)\nI Scalable number of subband processing units for the\nL band and the C band (ARPEGE IRIS-SBUIARPEGE\nIRMA-SBU)\n\nIperating principle of the ARPEGE IRMA-4G satellite monitoring system\n\n\nI\n\nGateway station\n\nARPEGE ISIS-4G/IRIS-4G/IRMA-4G Satellite M~bnitoringSystem 11\n\n\fFunctional description\nSubbands assigned to each other in the L band and in the\nC band are received at different sites. They are digitally\ndownconverted (DDC), and each subband is dispatched\nvia a LAN to an SBU at the respective site. The traffic\nchannels and signaling channels are then processed in\nthe same manner as in the ARPEGE IRIS4G system.

Even though the\ndedicated line between the central stiation and the remote\nsensor station in the target area may be down for several\nhours, the GMR-2 data intercepted during isolated operation can be reconstructed at a later time.\nARPEGE also provides custom-tailored, project-specific\nhybrid solutions. If the broadband dedicated line goes\ndown, the system switches to isolated operation and can\nautomatically establish a narrowband backup link (e.g. via\nVSAT or mobile radio). The resource rnanagement function transmits interception-related information (IRI) and\nselected call contents (CC) via the narrowband backup\nlink. Despite the limited WAN connection, the customer\ncan largely continue to gain intelligenze about missionrelevant GMR-2 subscribers.

Subscribers need\na special data cable and a PC in order to send fax or e-mail\nmessages via a GMR-2 mobile phone.\n\nDemodulation and channel decoding\nFax and data information is transmitted via logical traffic\nchannels at higher data rates. The call setup procedure\nfor fax and data transmissions is in the beginning identical to that used for voice links. At the end of the call setup\nprocedure - i.e. after authentication - a reallocation to traffic channels with a higher transmission rate takes place.\nCompared with logical voice channels, the decoding of\nfax and data channels requires twice or three times the\namount of resources.\nSource decoding\nIntercepted fax data is converted to a readable picture format (source decoding). For data links, intercepted binary\ndata is analyzed by means of a data decoder and represented in a suitable format.\nThe optional ARPEGE IRIS-DAF data and fax expansion\nincludes all components necessary to intercept fax and\ndata traffic, i.e.:\nI Channel decoder software for SBUs\nI Data decoder for decoding data traffic\nI GMR-2 fax source decoder\n\n\fConvenient,\nsubscriber-oriented\nanalysis with the\nARPEGE monitoring\ncenter\n\nGMR-2 activity analysis software\nThe data stored in the database is subjected to extensive\nanalysis using the system-specific software. Analysis can\nbe carried out according to spot-beam-specific or time\ncriteria, and can also be correlated with information gained\nfrom other sources. Operators can use predefined filters or\ngenerate database queries of their own using a convenient\ninput mask. Results are displayed in a table andlor graphically on a digital spot beam map. A number of tools are\navailable to help operators configure and operate the system in line with their specific requirements, thus optimizing work efficiency. The various events displayed on the\nmap are assigned different colors and symbols, which can\nbe configured by the operator.\nThe operator can define alarm criteria, e.g.:\nI Calls from a specific area (GMR-2 spot beam)\nI Specific lMSl activity\n\nI\n\nMap display (example)\n\nThe map display can be filtered according to a variety of\ncriteria.

The spot beams are selected from an electronic\nmap that displays the spot beam footprints. Mission-relevant\nGMR-2 session contents are stored on the session server,\nwhich is part of the ARPEGE monitoring center. The monitoring center software offers tools and functions supporting\nthe following operations for strategic contents analysis:\nI Tasking\nI Processing\nI Analysis\nI Reporting\nOperators administrate the object data of subscribers of interest in the target database as required for the mission to\nbe performed. To identify new subscribers, all calls can be\nstored in the session database in the open-channel mode.\nThe database application allows calls to be filtered, e.g. according to specific areas, area codes, telephone numbers,\nidentities (IMEI, IMSI) and other GMR-2-specific parameters.\nAny combination of filter criteria can be used. The session\ndatabase automatically assigns sessions to specific operators, who are defined in the target database. The operators\nassess the recorded information and, if appropriate, generate reports, or log calls in the subscriber history lists in the\ntarget database. Evaluators can display the spot beams in\nwhich GMR-2 subscribers are active on an electronic map.\n\nINetwork analyrer viewer (example)\n\nPhone\n.-L>.\n\nI\n\n\\ \\ l ///\nObject 0-Bos!\n\nComponents of contents analysis subsystem\nContents analysis is performed by means of the following\ncomponents:\nI Session server with mass memory and ARPEGE monitoring center (redundant session server system optionally\navailable on request)\nI Workstations for GMR-2 mobile activity analysis\n(one workstation included in ARPEGE ISIS-4G)\nI Workstations for GMR-2 contents analysis\nThe workstations for contents analysis are suitable for\nusers operating at different hierarchical levels and handling different tasks. Access rights and security levels can\nbe individually defined and administrated by means of the\nintegrated user management. The number of workstations\ncan be scaled to customer's requirements.\n\nNetwork analysis\nThe ARPEGE monitoring center software includes analysis\ntools that support evaluators in determining relationships\nbetween subscribers that are difficult to recognize in the\nresult lists produced by a database query. The identification of communications between subscribers is based on\nphone numbers and on GMR-2-specific identities, see figure \"Network analyzer viewer (example)\".\n\n\fSafe investment\ndue to sustained\nsystem concept\nThe rapid advances in satellite communications and the\nrelatively short life cycles of satellite services require economic and future-ready interception concepts also in the\narea of satellite intelligence (Satlnt). Satellite operators\nimplement new services by means of firmware updates\nof their satellites (space segment). Plus, new services\nconverge to yield uniform procedures and standards\n(spot beam technology, FDMA, TDMA, DAMA).\nThe principles for monitoring and intercepting the various types of GMR-based systems are nearly identical.\nThe ARPEGE ISIS-4GlIRIS-4GlIRMA-4G GMR-2 satellite\nmonitoring systems therefore use a universal hardware\nplatform. An existing GMR-2 monitoring system can be\nexpanded to include a Thuraya (GMR-1) monitoring system by adding nearly the same hardware components as\nused in the existing system.

The number of GMR-2 activities within\na region can change as a result of external influences\n(e.g. natural disasters, major events, unrest). The focus on\nmissions and areas of interest for operations will change\naccordingly.\nIn the example configuration discussed here, a total\nof nine ARPEGE IRIS-SBUs are provided at the central\nstation. The ARPEGE IRIS-SBUs support three modes of\noperation:\nITwo-way interception in standard mode (requires two\nDDC channels per SBU)\nI One-way intercept~onin remote mode in conjunction\nwith a remote sensor (requires one DDC channel per\nSBU plus one common DDC pilot channel)\nI One-way interception in C-band-only mode (requires\none DDC channel per SBU plus one common DDC pilot\nchannel)\nThe RF frontend of ARPEGE IRIS-4G supports the processing of up to 32 DDC subbands. Each DDC subband has\n(typically) 32 voice channels. Up to 16 ARPEGE IRIS-SBUs\ncan therefore be operated ~ntwo-way intercept~onmode\nin conjunction with an RF frontend. This ylelds a channel\n\n\fDepending on the area of interest and the missions t o be\nperformed, channel capacity can be distributed in different\nways between the central station and the remote sensors.\n\ncapacity of 512 duplex voice channels. In the example\nconfiguration discussed here, the channel capacity is\n288 duplex voice channels for local coverage (9 X 32).\nAlternatively, all nine ARPEGE IRIS-SBUs of the central\nstation can be operated in one-way interception mode,\nyielding a channel capacity of typically 288 simplex voice\nchannels. The ARPEGE IRMA-SBUs of the two remote\nsensor stations A and B process the local L band downlinks. In conjunction with the ARPEGE IRIS-SBUs of the\ncentral station being operated in remote mode, this results\nin a total of typically 288 duplex voice channels (two\nremote sensors plus the central station).\n\nFor further questions regarding the scaling of the channel\ncapacity of the GMR-2 (ACeSIISAT) monitoring system and\nthe required number of remote sensors, please contact\nour Sales department.\n\nIConfiguration and components of ARPEGE ISIS-4G/IRIS-4G/IRMA-4G example system\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n(free expanslon\n\nI\n\nARPEGE IM-AC\n\nsII\n\n(free expansion s\n(free expansion z\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nIfroo ovn3nrinn r\n\n(free expar\n\n)\n\n(free expansion :\n\n\nexpansion :\n\nRemote sensor\nB\nARPEGE IM-AL\n\nARPEGE IM-AL\n:entral monitorin,\nstation\n\n(free expansion r\nWAN\nARPEGE IRMA-I\nARPEGE IRMA-I\n\nRemote sensor\n\nARPEGE ISIS-4GIIRIS4GIIRMA-4G Satellite Monitoring S y s t e m 21\n\n\fSpecifications\nin brief\n\nThe ARPEGE ISIS-4GlIRIS-4GlIRMA4G GMR-2 satellite monitoring system has been designed for handling\nthe frequency ranges and procedures used in the GMR-2\nsystem.\n\nReceiving system\nFrequency range, C band\nReceivingantenna\n\n3600 MHz to 3800 MHz\n7.3 m to 9 m parabolic antenna (ARPEGE IM-AC),\nrighthand and lefthand circular polarization\n140 MHz\n2 X 40 MHz (ARPEGE ISIS-4G)\n4 X 40 MHz (ARPEGE ISIS-4G + ARPEGE ISIS-4G-X)\n1525 MHz to 1559 MHz\n(ARPEGE IM-AL) receiving antenna, circular polarization\n140 MHz\n34 MHz\nscalable number of processing units in a system\n\nlntermediatefrequency\nBandwidth\nFrequency range, L band\nReceiving antenna\nlntermediatefrequency\nBandwidth\nSignal processlng\nARPEGE ISIS4GIARPEGE I S I S 4\nActivity monitoring\n\n+ ARPEGE ISIS-4GX\n\nDeterminationof uplinkldownlink frequency mapping\nlnformation provided by ARPEGE ISIS-4G\n\nARPEGE IRIS-4GIARPEGE I R M A 4\nlnformation additionally provided by ARPEGE IRIS-4GlARPEGE IRMA-4G\n(as compared to ARPEGE ISIS4G)\n\nARPEGE IRIS-SBUIARPEGE IRMA-SBU\nSpot beams per SBU (standard or remote mode)\nSubband processlng capac~typer SBU\nSess~ons/channels\nper subband\n- - --\n\n-\n\n,/\n\nlnterceptlon of SDCCH contents of a satellite footprint by means of\nw~debandconcept\n0 s to 5 S (the actual tlme needed 1s a stochastlc value)\nI t~mestamp\nI spot beam ID\nI reason for actlvatlng the moblie phone (e g mob~le-ortg~nated\ncall,\nresponse to paglng, locat~onupdate)\nI lMSl of satell~tetermlnal (SIM card)\nI called telephone number\n\n(mobile-originatedcall)\ncaller's telephone number (mobile-terminatedcall)\nI identifying characteristics, e.g. IMEl of mobile phone, lMSl of SIM card\ni I recorded call contents, e.g. voice, circuit-switched data or fax\nI\n\nI\n\n~\n\nup to 4 subbands w~thinone spot beam\nup\nto 40 (32 typical)\n- .. -\n\nRequirements on data link to remote sensor\nIn general, a permanent data link is required between the\nremote L band sensor and the central station.

A data rate of\n2 Mbitls permits the simultaneous processing of 120 channels (at permanent full capacity). In the uplink, the sensor sends L band raw data to the central station. A G.703\nframe relay or an ISDN 2SM unframed link should be used\nas a data link. Other types of data links are available on\nrequest (e.g. VSAT).

While security and surveillance operations\nform an integral part of any security strategy, the ability\nto understand, analyze and interpret the significance of\ninformation gathered as part of day-to-day operations is a\nfundamental requirement for all security environments.\nAutonomy Virage's security and surveillance solutions support\nevery stage of security and surveillance operations, improve\nand promote situational awareness, provide an extensive range\nof advanced recognition and recording systems as well as\ncapabilities for instant and post-event retrieval and analysis.\nAt the heart of Autonomy's groundbreaking technology is the\nIntelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL), a single platform\nwhich is optimized for fast processing and retrieval of data in all formats. By forming an understanding of the inherent\nmeaning and potential significance of any piece of information, Autonomy's technology brings fresh, intelligent insight\nand immediate analytical capabilities to all operational and security environments. Advanced recognition technologies\noriginally developed for security services provide a strong foundation for a sophisticated product range.\nThe core platform includes:\nCommand and Control\nDigitallNetwork Video Recording (DVRINVR)\nAutomatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)\nIntelligent Scene Analysis System (isAS)\nElectronic Point of Sale Monitoring (EPOS)\nContainer Surveillance Management System (CSM)\nFace Recognition\n\nAll products may be used as individual components on a standalone basis or as part of a wider integrated solution to\ncreate a centralized control and management center. Increasing volumes and types of data create the need to adopt\ncomprehensive strategies which encompass all security data and where relevant, integrate these with operational data\nas well.\nAutonomy's unique technology allows organizations to monitor vast quantities of information from disparate sources,\nunderstand all data gathered at a conceptual level and place each piece of information in context with other known\nintelligence. This ensures that operations are more efficient, productivity is improved, results are enhanced and\n\n\f\fCompany Background\nFounded in 1996, Autonomy is a financially stable company, profitable in\nevery quarter for over eight years with solid cash generation and no net\ndebt. Autonomy has a global presence with dual headquarters in Cambridge,\n\nUK, and San Francisco, USA, and offices throughout the world including\nNorth America, Western Europe, Australia, Asia Pacific, Japan and China.\nAn extensive partner network combining the expertise of local integrators and global consultancy services provides a strong\nroute to market.

Human error accounts for virtually all failures\nto respond appropriately to video surveillance signals. Numerous studies suggest that up to 85% of onscreen information\ngoes unnoticed once a system operator has been on duty for a mere fifteen minutes, rendering a traditional command\ncenter system desperately inefficient.\nMultiple duties and discontinuity in personnel, such as shift changes and high staff turnover, contribute to\nreduced efficiency and dramatically decrease the quality of surveillance operations\nHuman concentration span typically wanes after 45 minutes according to scientific studies\nTypical surveillance shifts lasting up to 12 hours and far exceed the normal human concentration span and\ncontribute significantly to failures to identify and respond to unusual, illegal or suspicious behaviors\nHuman operators are unable to identify links or patterns across different information sets\nTraditional approaches to Security and Surveillance rely on indiscriminate recording and manual processing of video, which\nare frequently proven to be costly and ineffective. Disparate data sources, information delivered in incompatible formats,\nand the inability to automate processes and interactions, mean that traditional approaches often miss or fail to pick up\nimportant events and identify potential threats to security, or malpractice within the organization. Resources can be added\nto overcome these shortcomings, but this is far from the optimal solution.\nThe fundamental issue is that traditional security systems do not actually understand what is occurring or how it might\nrelate to other events that have occurred in the local vicinity during a short time period. Relationships can therefore not be\nidentified using traditional approaches. Additionally, traditional systems cannot effectively describe the footage for real-time\nreporting or later reuse as part of a case or investigation. To manage this data effectively, security systems need a new\nway to process information, moving away from manually monitoring and tagging video footage to an approach whereby\ncomputers can understand the information and process it in the same way a human would -that is, by comprehending its\nmeaning to reveal patterns and trends which may have gone unnoticed otherwise.\n\n\"With its suite ofpowerfil technologies, Autonomy Virage is able to meet a wide range\nofsecurity and surveillance applications rangingfrm highly complex command and\ncontrol center deployments to small-scale securityfunctions.\n\"\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\fAutonomy Virage's Approach to\nSecurity and Surveillance\nAutonomy was founded on the basis that technology should map to the human world, not the other\nway around. This methodology is the foundation for Autonomy's Intelligent Data Operating Layer\n(IDOL), a data-agnostic technology that overcomes the barriers of language, format, and connectivity\nthat typically hinder traditional technologies. IDOL, the underlying platform technology of all Autonomy\nsolutions, provides a level of interoperability, secure access, scalability and understanding that cannot\nbe achieved by traditional solutions.\nIn high level security and surveillance operations the need has never been greater for advanced\ntechnologies that can make sense of rich media information and instantly alert the relevant parties to\ncrucial intelligence.\nWhile observation forms an integral part of any security strategy, the ability to understand, analyze and interpret the\nsignificance of information gathered as part of surveillance operations is a fundamental requirement for all security\nenvironments today. Increasing volumes and types of data, including video footage, camera stills, vehicle registration plates,\ntraffic records, police databases, immigration records, telephone conversations and transaction reports are integral to security\noperations and necessitate the adoption of comprehensive strategies that encompass all security data.\nAutonomy Virage delivers a complete infrastructure solution for security operations by leveraging IDOL, which forms\na conceptual and contextual understanding of content in any file format - video, text or voice-based, structured or\nunstructured - regardless of where it is stored, how it was created, or which application is associated with the data.\nBecause of this \"data-agnostic\" approach, IDOL can identify relationships between disparate data types and form important\nconnections vital to discovering security breaches that previously hinged on costly and unreliable manual labor. By forming\na conceptual understanding of unstructured content, IDOL automates key processes, thereby driving substantial cost\nsavings for the security and surveillance industry.\n\nIDOL - Understanding Meaning\nIDOL is the information processing platform that lies at the heart of Autonomy Virage solutions.\nIDOL uniquely forms an understanding of all content in an enterprise so that the relationships\nbetween concepts can be detected, no matter the form in which they are expressed. Based on\nthat understanding, real-time information can be automatically processed and analyzed. This not\nonly improves operational productivity but also offers enhanced situational awareness and threat detection as relationships\nbetween seemingly unrelated events can be identified and reacted to.\n\nXutonomy is the market leader in the provision ofsoftware that automates the\nanalysis of unstructured data, whether in theform oftext, audio, images or video.\"\nURS.lub 2008\n\n\f\fConnecting the Dots\nThe ability to process all forms of digital information including video, audio, and text, on a single platform enables\nAutonomy to offer unique solutions to a growing number of organizations and enterprises that are increasingly dependent\non utilizing unstructured information. With the organization standardized on IDOL as its only information access platform,\nall electronic structured, semi-structured and unstructured information existing within the enterprise can be automatically\nindexed for quick and easy identification and retrieval whenever necessary.\nA single backbone that connects all business applications, security systems, and data repositories is essential if holistic\nsolution is to be attained. The ability to monitor and track all forms of information and relate them to one another is critical\nin this information age.\nThe convergence of operational, compliance and security needs is occurring rapidly. No longer can an organization have\nseparate systems for each of these important operations. Effective threat detection needs to occur within the organization as\nwell as at its boundary and needs to encompass all data types, particularly video and audio.\nAutonomy is unique in its ability to offer this level of connectivity, understanding and risk assessment on a real-time basis.\n\nThe Need for Situational Awareness\nSituational awareness is the perception of environmental elements within a period of time and space, the comprehension\nof their meaning, and the projection of their impact into the future. It is a field of study that extends far beyond security\nrequirements and is critical when dealing with complex, dynamic scenarios that can span from intelligence gathering, air\ntraffic control, power plant operations, military command and control to more ordinary but nevertheless complex tasks such\nas driving an automobile or monitoring a crowd at a sporting event.\nLacking or having inadequate situational awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed\nto human error. It thus becomes a critical goal when there is a high volume of information flow and where poor decision\nmaking leads to serious consequences.\nBy providing outstanding Situational Awareness, Autonomy Virage empowers companies to:\nIncrease operational efficiencies\nBetter allocate resources to areas in which the technology has indicated a future impact\nProvided with real-time analysis, companies can respond quickly and precisely to prevent further damage\nOptimize resources and cost distribution to focus on their most critical areas\n\nSecurity\nManagement\n\n10 Autonomy Virage's Approach to SecuritV and Surveillance\n\n\fAutonomy Virage's approach to achieving Situational Awareness is to build a framework that extends from the monitoring of\nsingle events to building complex networks of related activity to offer reactive and proactive capabilities.\nEvent Stream Processing (ESP): the ability to monitor CCTV footage, understand the content and alert accordingly,\ne.g., if person walks too close to the edge of the platform, it can raise an alarm so closer monitoring can occur\nSecurity Processing Management: building on ESP capabilities and allowing for business rules to be captured, e.g.,\nif a car license plate is recorded in the HR system, then a parking lot barrier can be raised automatically\nComplex Event Processing: by adding IDOL'S conceptual understanding, more complex events can be built and\nunseen relationships between different events can be discovered, e.g., a car seen loitering near a retail bank\nbranch and an the employee card used in an access-denied event share the address of a recently terminated\nemployee\n\n\f\fProducts and Solutions\nThe sensitive nature of these products and the type of operations they are managing makes it inappropriate to offer actual\ncase studies. References can be obtained on request but for the purposes of this document we are providing generic\ncustomer use cases to demonstrate how the powerful Autonomy Virage solution is used in real world situations.\n\nProtecting Public Infrastructure\nContinued urbanization is putting growing pressure on the metropolitan environment. With close to half of the world's population\nnow living in cities, protecting and improving the urban landscape is an increasing priority for local and central government.\nThis requires flexible technology and integrated policies to address diverse challenges such as reducing anti-social behavior,\nstreet crime, protecting infrastructure and public buildings, and improving transportation networks.\n\nPublic Safety - City Center\nAutonomy Virage's broad suite of IP-based applications offer automated solutions for preventing\ncrime and vandalism, implementing effective infrastructure management and identifying how\nbest to invest resources in the future. Bringing together best-of-breed technologies in video\nsurveillance and analytics, Autonomy Virage provides state of the art monitoring solutions,\nincluding Digital and Network Recording (DVWNVR), Autonomy Virage Intelligent Scene\nAnalysis System (ISAS), Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) and Autonomy Virage\nCommand and Control. Autonomy's open architecture allows seamless connectivity with old or new systems to leverage\nexisting investments and create a complete intelligent security network. The infrastructure has been specifically designed to\nallow easy integration of third party equipment such as display units and alarm panels. All of Autonomy Virage's technology\nis massively scalable to meet changing user requirements and is easy to use with minimal training through a single\nintuitive interface.\nKey Benefits:\n\n-\n\n2417 intelligent surveillance across large areas\nAutomatic alerting based on pre-defined triggers or abnormal behavior\nDirect lines to law enforcement\nAdvanced recording capabilities offer video evidence which can lead to successful prosecution\n\nRoads\nThe growing number of public and private vehicles on the road is putting increasing pressure on urban infrastructure. In\norder to tackle congestion and other issues effectively, local transportation authorities must have reliable, real-time data on\nthe problems they face and a complete picture of changing transportation trends.\nAutonomy Virage offers a range of proactive solutions to automate the monitoring and management of transportation\nnetworks on any scale, such as dynamic traffic surveys, incident detection and enforcement, real-time infrastructure\nmanagement and speed monitoring. Solutions include Autonomy Virage Command and Control, Automatic NumberILicense\nPlate Recognition (ANPWALPR), Autonomy Virage Intelligent Scene Analysis System (ISAS), and Container Surveillance\n& Management System (CSM). Autonomy Virage automates proactive network management to reduce costs and deliver\nsignificant ROI.\n\nProducts and Solutions\n\n\n\fAutomating the processes of identifying and tracking vehicles has valuable applications for both commercial and law\nenforcement purposes. With the capability to connect to multiple databases and automatically cross reference and correlate\nidentified license plates with other data, Autonomy Virage provides numerous benefits for organizations that must tap into\nmultiple sources of data to make quick, informed decisions.\nIn addition to assisting in traffic law enforcement and vehicle identification, Autonomy Virage ANPR is also used to\nstreamline logistics operations such as loading and unloading goods at distribution centers. By automatically matching\nvehicle numberllicense plates with information held in local databases, Virage ANPR triggers entry authorization and\nautomatically directs vehicles to designated bays where relevant documentation will be waiting so that loading and\nunloading can commence immediately.\n\n(case Study - Protecting Motorways\nMotorways present a difficult challenge for security and surveillance operations. With a large number of possible\ninfringements, illegal maneuvers and dangerous driving to look out for, most intelligent video monitoring solutions\nfail to correctly identify infractions and potential threats as the dynamics of the events constantly change.\nAutonomy Virage won the contract for a Government project which uses the Intelligent Scene Analysis System\n(ISAS) to monitor, detect and penalize lane violations and illegal overtaking on motorways.\nBy recognizing abnormal patterns of activity, iSAS can identify erratic driving, dangerous overtaking, speeding and\naccidents all through one platform solution. The system automatically identifies any infringements, records images\nof the offense and transmits them back to the control center. The police computer system then uses the plate\ndetails to identify the driver and issue a ticket and fine notification to the offending driver instantaneously. This is\nall made possible with Autonomy Virage's technology, which allows the system to form an understanding of the\nvideo and recognize dynamic of the event.\nAutonomy Virage was also commissioned to deploy iSAS across service areas along the motorway. These monitor\nstrategic areas to detect and deter dangerous or illegal parking and suspicious behavior associated with car theft as\nwell as monitor the length of time cars have been parked and abnormal behavior such as running crowds, which\nmay suggest an emergency has occurred.\nReal-time analysis and alerting translate directly to expedited response so that the necessary action can be taken.\nSince the deployment of Autonomy Virage's solution, road traffic accidents have decreased by over 70%.\n\nHigh Performance in All Conditions\nAutomatic format checking places each plate reading in context by verifying the identified number plate against typical\ntemplates in any given territory. By taking multiple readings of each plate and using sophisticated probability matching\ntechniques to analyze and calculate the likelihood that any given reading is correct, ANPR is able to recognize number\nplates extremely accurately.\nAutonomy Virage's ANPR can accurately identify numberllicense plates even in the most demanding conditions, such as\nwhen visibility is low due to adverse weather or poor light conditions. In addition, ANPR is able to capture and identify\nsquare, inverse, borderless and foreign plates automatically. Where required, adjustments to contrast, plate size, country\nnumberllicense plate format, skew and rotation settings can be made by the operator to fine tune the system in order to\nachieve optimum performance in specific conditions. In addition, Autonomy Virage enables recording via digital triggering to\nachieve a 100% capture rate.\n\n\n14 Froducts and Stilutitim\n\n\fWhether your need is defined by reducing traffic, protecting installed assets or planning urban developments, Autonomy\nVirage's next-generation technology can help you maximize your transport network, now and in the future\n\nSea Ports\nIt has been estimated that there are up to 19 million containers currently in transition globally\nand that traffic is increasing at a rate of about 10 percent annually. Given the ever increasing\nvolumes of traffic, vehicle and container identification and tracking has never been so\nimportant to the logistics industry. Organizations need to know not only where containers are\nand when they will be delivered, but also more detailed information such as what condition\nthe containers were in at various stages throughout their journey and by whom and where\nthey were accessed along the way. Autonomy Virage's Container Surveillance Management (CSM) enables comprehensive\nvehicle and container identification and tracking in logistics environments; from seaports and inland container terminals\nto rail container terminals. Automation within CSM removes the need for costly additional manual input and makes\nthe identification, tracking, control and management of logistic processes highly efficient. A unique combination of core\ntechnologies and superior analytical capabilities gives CSM the power to provide added intelligence, such as crossreferencing with existing databases and advanced information processing operations such as clustering and hyperlinking\nof related material. Such intelligent processing can be used to improve future operations and deliver significant benefits to\nbusinesses.\ndirage CSM automatically captures vehicle and container information, including:\nVehicle numberllicenseplate\nContainer IS0 numbers\nContainer type\nContainer damage recording\nSite and gate location\nDateltime\nBy capturing this information accurately and efficiently, Autonomy Virage CSM not only enables businesses to keep an\naccurate record of exactly when and where containers pass through certain points in the transport network. In addition,\nthrough high quality digital video recording and management, Virage CSM automatically keeps track of what condition\ncontainers are in at various stages of their journey throughout the world. By capturing this cross section of data, Autonomy\nVirage provides complex cross referencing for 24171365 operations. CSM can significantly increase traffic efficiency as the\nsystem works on moving vehicles as well as those which are static. CSM works on standard 20, 30, 40, 45 and 20x20\nfoot containers.\n\nAirport\nAirports face a wide variety of daily security challenges ranging from the protection of the\naircrafts and staff to the mitigation of crime such as drugs trafficking and weapons smuggling.\nBy providing security operations through a single platform, Autonomy Virage takes a holistic\napproach to airport security, identifying patterns and trends which may be overlooked if\nseparate systems are operating in parallel. Autonomy Virage's Control Center is ideal for this type of large installation where\ndisparate events and sources need to be addressed individually but considered part of the big picture.\n\n\flex investigation, o f f e r\n\n\f'case Study - Airport Security\nA major international airport was seeking to upgrade its ten-year old security surveillance system in order to better\nprotect public safety in the face of the threat of international terrorism and crime. Its existing system consisted of\n\n27 time-lapse video recorders and CCTV multiplexers that multiplexed the incoming camera video signals to be\nrecorded on the VCRs.\nThe airport wanted to replace its video security and surveillance system with a much more efficient and effective\ndigital recording system. The airport proposed to replace all the existing VCRs with a new, state of the art digital\nrecording system capable of recording up to 800 camera signals and storing all footage securely for 4 weeks\nbefore being over-written. Another specification was that the system would be able to automatically archive any\nspecified video footage with suspicious-looking activity, and this archived footage would remain in a secure place\nshould access be needed.\nAutonomy Virage was selected to provide flexible remote surveillance capabilities, offering auto dial-out on alarm,\ndial-in, or continuous image transmission, all across wide or local area networks. Live images can be retrieved and\nreviewed and system parameters can be configured and diagnosed remotely.\n\nPrivate In@astructure\nThe challenges posed to private infrastructure are highly complex and can come from both internal and external sources.\nThere can be specific threats that need assessing; or health and safety (including public safety) requirements that need to\nbe monitored at high risk locations such as oil refineries or nuclear power stations.\nBecause of this dual threat, insights offered from the relevant operational data that exists within the organization such as\nHR or customer records should be considered when trying to pre-empt issues or resolve outstanding actions.\n\nHealth and Safety\nIncreasing regulation and more stringent penalties mean that health and safety initiatives cannot be taken lightly. Rather,\nhealth and safety policies need to be strictly monitored and enforced. For instance, what should happen if a diesel spillage\noccurs on a petrol forecourt and no employee has had appropriate training? Enforcing and monitoring policies can be\nachieved by training the surveillance system to understand when a breach of policy has occurred and what needs to occur\nwhen this happens. This makes corporations more aware and ensures that they meet the minimum requirements and\nguarantee the safety of all employees, customers, partners and the general public.\n\nRetail\nDetecting fraudulent activity is a key concern, particularly amongst petrol stations, confectioners, tobacconists, newsagents,\nconvenience stores, supermarkets, pubs and clubs and fast food outlets. More than ever, companies are seeking new\nmeasures to combat this illegal activity; however, many businesses still only rely on manual surveillance techniques alone.\nWith internal employee theft on the rise and current systems falling short of the mark, businesses need to implement new\nmeasures to detect and prevent fraudulent activity.\n\n\fCombined with synchronous capture of cash register transactional data, Autonomy\nVirage offers retailers the most versatile and efficient surveillance and retail\nmanagement system available. Full data capture, including time synchronized image\nand transactional data together with centralized reporting and management enable\nretailers to monitor multiple locations simultaneously and correlate results from multiple\ncash registers both locally and remotely. Multiple site data and daily reports can be\nsent to and managed from a central location and remote access enables off site reports\nand investigations.\nVirage offers an unrivalled combination of high quality DVRINVR and EPOS monitoring in one powerful package. Designed to\ndetect and deter fraudulent activity at the Point of Sale, EPOS synchronization associates POS transactional data with DVRI\nNVR CCTV footage. In this way, Autonomy Virage EPOS acts as an early warning system by alerting surveillance staff to\nsuspicious or illegal activity at the cash register, as it happens. Rules-based keyword matches, based on given requirements,\nallow alerts to be triggered at the POS when transactions such as voids, refunds, discounts and cashback are activated.\nIn addition to providing live EPOS monitoring, Virage enables playback of pre-recorded images. DVRINVR data can be\nanalyzed post event by reviewing data stored on the HDD. All data is stored in a database at the time it is created and can\nbe quickly and easily located as and when required for future analysis. Retrospective investigation options support a full\nrange of retrieval options such as transaction data, video images or multiple parameters.\nTransaction data is searchable by:\nDate\nTime\nProduct\nPrice\nTill Number\nOther search parameters (including multiple parameters) based on pre-defined rules e.g. void plus cashback\nUnder no circumstances is transactional data automatically burned onto the video imagery as this could render the CCTV\nfootage useless. In the event that users wish to display transactional data with the video footage, users can choose to\noverlay transactional data on top of video footage. Where multiple cameras are in use, users can search all cameras\nsimultaneously through a single interface, or simply narrow their search to results from a specified camera.\nAdvanced analytics such as clustering (identifying related groups of data) enable the discovery of trends and correlations\nacross the entire data set, providing the ability to spot unusual activity spanning multiple cash registers which may have\notherwise gone undetected. Conceptual analytics which use unique pattern matching techniques to detect underlying trends\nand anomalies in any given data set, enable retailers to gain greater insight into all transactional data and corresponding\nvideo images.\n\nCorporate Facilities\nCorporate facilities can range from simple car park access to monitoring a global network of retail bank branches. The\nflexibility of the Autonomy Virage system means that a hub and spoke approach to security can be applied allowing for\nreal-time actionable operational intelligence. Increasing regulation and continuous terrorist threats mean that base level of\nmonitoring at facilities such as refineries, wells, chemical plants, manufacturing plants, and sensitive corporate locations\nis increasing. The minimum requirement is now for advanced video analytics that understand and process events as they\nunfold and ensure the security staff are continuously operating at an optimum productivity level.\n\n\fCase Study - Corporate Security\nA large business complex comprising of a hotel, a business center, an amusement park, a mosque, and a\nsupermarket, needed a comprehensive security and surveillance installation. Autonomy Virage was selected to roll\nout a large-scale security implementation to monitor the premises, control access points, monitor the entry and\nexiting of vehicles, run facial recognition to help identify known criminals or suspects, and protect retail activity\nagainst crime and fraud. All the information then needs to be connected to the police's database for legal action to\nbe taken where necessary.\nTwo key advantages of Autonomy Virage's holistic methodology include its proactive approach to addressing\npotential risks as they arise and providing high quality video recording for retrospective analysis and investigations.\n\nPerimeter Security\nSecuring restricted areas, access points, and perimeters is where intelligent video solutions such as iSAS bring great\nbenefits to an organization. By automatically detecting events at these points, security guards can view and respond to the\nrelevant events rather than watching still images of\n\nCCN.This also frees up their time to engage in higher level activity\n\nincreasing productivity.\nControls access into roomslrestricted areas\nMonitors sterile areas\nDelivers real-time alerts to security breaches and intrusions\nAlerts proximity as objects approach your perimeter\n\n\"We need our staff and soldiers to have information at theirfingert@s to make\ndecisions that may be critical to our country's national security. Autonomy retrieves\nthe most relevant information so that Army personnel can spend their time anahing\ndata instead ofsearchingfor it. Autonomy's solution beat the competition in\ndelivering a scalable technology that flectively connects our users to the information\nthey need.\n\"\n\nLieutenant Colonel Kenneth Blakely, ChiefofArmy Knowledge Online, US Army\n\nP&u&\n\nand Solutions 19\n\n\f\fInvestigations\nIDOCs ability to form a conceptual and contextual understanding of the data allows for\nadvanced investigative capabilities. By analyzing the data set as a whole, IDOL can carry\nout advanced data analysis to reveal emerging patterns, potential threats, and similarities\nand links between cases. Manual investigations traditionally fall short when faced with\nthe vast amount of data to be analyzed. By putting data into context, IDOL can cross\nreference intelligence from disparate sources and run automatic analysis to streamline investigations.\nFor example, an intercepted radio conversation can be\nused to automatically identify the speakers, understand\nwhat is being discussed, and retrieve any existing\nintelligence regarding the subject. This helps to streamline\ntraditional investigative methods and facilitate investigative\nwork by performing conceptual analysis to reveal trends\nand patterns hidden in the data set.\nIn another instance, the ripple effect of an idea and the\nparties involved can be measured as it jumps from mail to\nphone conversation to document. Person A receives a call\n\nUnderstand communicationpatterns with advanced visualization\n\nfrom Person B who then relays it out of ear shot in the parking lot to Person C who then e-mails these ideas to Person D. This\npowerful mechanism can be applied to detect relationship dynamics and pinpoint the cause of a certain action taking place.\n\n\fProduct Portj4olio\nThe Autonomy Virage Security and Surveillance suite is modular and flex~bleand\ncan be expanded and adapted over time depending on local requirements or\nspecific budget constraints. It is based on IDOL technology enabling it to operate\nas a stand-alone security solution or as a component of a much larger distributed\ncorporate IT environment. The Autonomy Command and Control module is\nthe pivotal clearing-house for information via the intuitive Visor interface and\nis often the central hub of any implementation. The overall solution utilizes a\npre-configured three tier architecture that includes functions that range from a standard rules-base solution to a highly\nsophisticated solution that leverages that most cutting edge conceptual analysis capabilities. Each standard configuration\noffers an easy starting-point solution that may be further customized for the unique and specialized needs of the client.\nAutonomy's extensive investment in Research and Development results in a continual stream of innovation and functionality\nadvances. The remainder of this section will highlight specific Autonomy Virage technologies utilized in one or more of the\nfunctional areas listed below.\n\nCommand and Control\nGiven the complex nature of security and surveillance operations and the vast amount of\nheterogeneous data that requires aggregation and analysis, the need for advanced technologies\nthat can make sense of information and alert the relevant parties to crucial intelligence has never\nbeen so great. Bringing together best-of-breed technologies in video surveillance and analytics\nBusiness Process Management, and Meaning Based Computing, Command and Control\nproactively helps security officers retrieve relevant intelligence in real-time.\nCommand and Control is operated through Autonomy Virage Visor, a cohesive, user-friendly interface which provides users\nwith the functional tools required to configure security settings and control the scene. Since Command and Control is fully\nmodular, additional functionality can be added and controlled through the interface, as an enterprise's security needs dictate.\nAutonomy Virage's Security and Surveillance Command and Control infrastructure enables all Autonomy Virage products\nto interact seamlessly. It has been specifically designed to allow easy integration of third party equipment such as alarm\npanels and display units. Although certain products can be deployed for simple functions such as standalone capture and\narchive, in order to perform more advanced functions, Autonomy Virage provides three levels of Command and Control for a\nrange of different environments and needs from simplistic rule-based models to highly complex, intelligent solutions based\non conceptual analysis.\n\nLevel I: Event Stream Processing\nCommand and Control Level I offers a simple rule-based solution. Any number of Autonomy Virage products can be\nconnected with the Command and Control system, which performs per instructions defined by a systems administrator.\nFor example, if Autonomy Virage's DVR and EPOS were set up with Level I, the system could be programmed to highlight\nparticularly unusual till transactions such as large sums of cash-back on the logged till transaction data. Network Video\nRecording and Container Surveillance Management might also be deployed with Level I to monitor traffic at a port and\ncould be trained to raise a barrier for particular vehicles whilst disallowing entry for others.\n\n\fLevel II: Security Process Management\nIn addition to performing simple rule-based functions, Command and\nControl Level II handles logical interactions between disparate pieces of\ndata. The Security Process Management offered with Level II, powered by\nAutonomy's Liquid Office, automates the reporting process, reducing the\ncost of data entry and distribution of information to relevant users. This\napproach enables each report to provide richer and more relevant content\nand automatically classifies and distributes it to the relevant department.\nDigital Video Recording, Intelligent Scene Analysis System and Command\nand Control Level II might be used, for example, to monitor vehicle\nspeeds between points. By identifying the same object and calculating\nthe distance between the two points, the system can calculate distance\ntraveled within a given time frame and therefore the speed at which the\nvehicle/s must have been traveling. Another example might be deploying\nNetwork Video Recording and Automatic Number Plate Recognition\nto monitor car park usage in multiple locations and calculate usage\npercentages based on initial numbers collected to highlight which car\n\nI:\n1'\n\npark has the greatest usage.\nLevel Ill: Complex Event Monitoring\nCommand and Control Level Ill provides state-of-the-art security infrastructure software solution for all the most complex\nsecurity operations, automating a vast range of tasks and bringing conceptual understanding to all data. Halo, powered by\nAutonomy's award-winning Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL), employs advanced analytics to add intelligence to a wide\nrange of security operations and information retrieval. Halo is able to form a conceptual understanding of the meaning of\nany piece of data, be it in the form of text, video, or audio. By deriving an understanding of the available information assets,\nHalo automatically provides users with relevant background information, cross-referencing data according to its conceptual\ncontent to reveal emerging trends and identify potential threats, delivering it directly to the user in the form of hyperlinks or\nthematically similar clusters.\nAutonomy's core technology is used by some of the most prestigious intelligence and defense agencies including: the U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Securily, U.S. Department of Defense, The British Ministry of Defense, the Olympic Games Security\nCommittee, National Nuclear Security Administration and numerous others. One of the key reasons organizations choose\nAutonomy, is its ability to discover \"the unknown\" which has a significant impact upon the efficacy of many world-renowned\nsecurity agencies.\nAt this sophisticated level, Autonomy's cutting-edge Meaning Based Computing technology forms a conceptual understanding\nof all forms of unstructured, semi-structured and structured data be it video, audio or textual in format. At its core, the\ntechnology uses a combination of Bayesian Inference and Shannon's Information Theory to automatically extract the key\nconcepts from any piece of information. As a mathematical platform, it is not constrained by the limitations of linguistic or\nrules-based models. Distinct concepts, ideas and behaviors are exposed within any data set on the basis of mathematically\nderived coherence and not rigid conformity to predefined structures or characteristics. This enables the technology to recognize\nthe potential threat for the first time, both at a tactical and strategic level, without prior training or insight. Operationally, this\nresults in an intelligent surveillance infrastructure capable of instantly and automatically fusing vast quantities of heterogeneous\ndata, identifying interrelationships, spotting important trends and alerting surveillance officers to this vital intelligence.\nAdditional functionality can be seamlessly added in order to perform further advanced data fusion operations.\n\n\fLevel IV: Secure Archiving, Retention and Disposition Management\nProviding evidence for court cases, compliance regulations, and risk management are just a few of the primary reasons\nwhy video needs to be archived. Many organizations and police forces are swamped with CCTV footage which is neither\nproperly filed nor securely managed.\nAutonomy Virage offers an enhanced video archiving solution that ensures digital video is efficiently controlled and\nprotected, only accessible to those with the right access, and duly retained according to corporate and legislative rules.\nVideos that are to be used for evidential purposes are required to be held for a predetermined period in a guaranteed\nunchanged state. Legacy approaches have required the manual identification of such videos and the movement of these\ninto a stand-alone secure repository - a costly and time-consuming approach.\nUnlike traditional solutions, Autonomy Virage automates the retention and disposition of video footage by understanding the\nmeaning of all information regardless of format, language or repository through the power of Autonomy IDOL.\n\ncase Study - Securing the City Center\nA few years ago, growing crime figures and disorder were causing increasing problems for a bustling European city\ncenter. Disruptive, violent and drunken behavior was becoming the bane of people's lives, and policing strategies\nwere proving difficult to enforce without concrete evidence.\nHaving been set a target of reducing crime and anti-social behavior by 40%, the city council invested E6\nmillion in what has become one of the largest metropolitan CCTV installations. After a competitive procurement,\nAutonomy Virage was chosen to provide a vast network of Digital Video Recording (DVR) software and integrate\nover 280 cameras throughout the city. Autonomy Virage was chosen as the only vendor able to accommodate the\nvast amounts of data created every day and offer suitable archiving solutions. Users are able to access and retrieve\nevidence from multiple incidents simultaneously through a single, intuitive interface. Virage's digital recording\ntechnology also offers unrivalled imaging, delivering 'directed surveillance' for multiple enforcement agencies and\nensuring prosecutions through high-quality ID recognition shots.\nSince the installation there has been a dramatic reduction in the amount of crime and disruptive behavior in\nthe city center. Evidence from CCTV has helped various law enforcement organizations make more than 6,500\narrests over the past three years and operators in the control center are being called upon up to 6 0 times per day\nto provide footage as evidence. C C N footage provides concrete evidence in cases that otherwise may have gone\nunresolved, and officers estimate that footage will provide vital evidence in 8,700 cases this year ranging from\n\\murder,\n\nspeeding, and vandalism.\n\n1!4utonomy'sscene detection capabilities, together with advanced image recognition\n(fr example, 3Dface recognition) enables Autonomy to identzfi patterns in images\nand text.\"\n\n24 Products and Solutions\n\n\fIntelligent Scene Analysis System\n\nJ\n\nIntelligent Scene Analysis System (ISAS) is an advanced solution to assist users of any live or\nrecord C C N system in the detection of important activity. The system is fully trainable enabling\nit to detect many types of complex activities including identifying potential threats, an illegal\naction or a situation where help is required. iSAS dramatically improves the efficiency of any\nC C N system, automatically identifying specific or potential incidents to operators for verification,\naction or both.\n\nAutomatic LicenseINumber Plate Recognition\nAutonomy Virage's Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPRIALPRR) is the world's leading\nplate recognition system, employing state of the art neural network techniques in its character\nrecognition. This ensures efficiency and integrity of the system for use in either high volume\nor standard traffic flow situations. ANPR is utilized for many different applications, including\ncar parks, traffic surveys, petrol filling stations (as a \"drive-off\" deterrent), and to detect stolen\nvehicles if used in conjunction with database searching. ANPR also has time scheduling as a\nstandard facility to offer vehicle access control for commercial and industry entrylexit scenarios.\n\nContainer Surveillance Management\nContainer Surveillance Management (CSM) fully automates the recognition of both the vehicle\nand the container it is trailing in one smooth and simple process through the entry and exit\nlanes of sea ports, inland container terminals or rail container terminals. Due to the open\narchitecture design of CSM, the system has the advantage of being able to communicate and\ninterface with on-site management systems, eliminating a wide range of manual processes\nleading to significant return on investment.\n\nElectronic Point of Sale\nElectronic Point of Sale (EPOS) offers an unrivalled combination of high quality digital video\nrecording and EPOS monitoring in one package. Designed to detect dai\n\ndeter fraudulent activity\n\nat the \"point of sale,\" the system functions as a management tool that can reduce stock losses\nand increase profits. The combination of capturing high quality digital images and synchronized\ntill data gives the operator access to powerful image and till data both locally and remotely.\n\nDigitalINetwork Video Recording\nThe DigitalINetwork Video Recording (DVRINVR) solution offers a range of high quality video\nrecorders with advanced remote access capabilities. The line is designed to allow you to start\nat any capacity and expand as needed without any change to the underlying platform. With\na minimum of 1 input and a maximum of 65,000 inputs the system can be configure to\naccommodate any organizations current and future requirements.\n\n\\\\The world marketfor ANPR isforecast to exceed $440 million by 2013.\"\nIMS Research\n\nProducts and Solutions 25\n\n\f\fTechnology and Architecture\nAutonomy was founded on the basis that technology should map to the human\nworld, not the other way around. This basic premise led to the development of\nthe IDOL technology that is inherently agnostic to the barriers that typically stymie\ntraditional technologies.\nAutonomy's technology is highly sophisticated, efficient and fully scalable. Our\nscalability has been proven time and time again among our customer base, where\nour technology has been used to power some of the largest systems in the world\nAutonomy delivers linear scalability through a multi-threaded, multi-instance\napproach with load balancing to distribute the indexing and query workload whilst also supporting 64-bit architecture. This\nenhanced scalability results in hardware cost-savings as well as the ability to address larger volumes of documents.\n\nVideo Analytics Engine\nAutonomy Virage's advanced video analytics have been proven to increase the efficiency and efficacy of CCTV-based\nsurveillance operations dramatically by automatically detecting, analyzing and interpreting all activity within a field of view.\n\nIntelligent Video Analysis\nIn consultation with key security agencies, Autonomy Virage has developed a range of products designed to improve\nthe efficiency and efficacy of surveillance operations. By adding intelligence to the camera and understanding what is\nhappening at the video level, Autonomy Virage is able to automatically identify elements within the video and automatically\nalert security officers to breaches or events in real-time. This translates directly to operational advantages as Autonomy\nVirage enables organizations to anticipate and detect potential threats or illegal action, instantly and automatically, and take\nproactive preventative action against any security concerns. By detecting suspicious behaviors, identifying potential security\nthreats and providing alerts entirely automatically, Autonomy Virage enables CCTV operators to focus their activities on\nbehaviors which require attention and verification by a security professional.\n\nInstant Recognition and Analysis\nIn order to correctly identify suspicious behavior, it is essential that any object or\nmovement is placed in context. Using advanced techniques, Autonomy identifies\nand categorizes objects in a scene by size, shape, color, speed, direction, location\nand time of day and, over time, builds up a history of these objects. By then\nputting each object and motion in context, using techniques such as comparing\nobject histories, Video Motion Detect (VMD), Non Motion Detect (NMD), object\nsizing, object tracking, object counting and behavioral analysis, Autonomy\nenables surveillance staff to more accurately interpret the threat that any given\nobject or motion may pose. Autonomy performs multiple levels of recognition and\nanalysis on video data from simple tasks such as identifying movement within a\nscene through to complex behavioral analysis.\n\nTechnology and Architecture 27\n\n\fBehavioral Analysis\nBehavioral analysis offers the most advanced form of scene recognition. Once an object has been identified and is being\ntracked by Autonomy Virage's Security and Surveillance technology, the system is capable of employing more sophisticated\ntechniques for further analysis. Virage iSAS is able to differentiate between various scenarios by placing all identified\nbehavior within the context of normal behaviors as specified by the user. By applying an associated motion history to an\nobject, iSAS can automatically undertake complex behavioral analysis in order to recognize unusual or suspicious activity\nand alert surveillance staff to this immediately.\n\nFace Recognition\nAutonomy Virage also offer other powerful biometric identification tools in addition to audio recognition. The Virage fingerprint\nrecognition solution uses the same established fingerprint minutiae techniques as a police fingerprint expert - this enables\nfingerprints to be located and matched against a database of millions in order to successfully identify individuals. In addition,\nAutonomy Virage provides facial recognition technology where other biometrics, such as fingerprint analysis, are not suitable.\nFacial recognition techniques are often used, for example, if suspects need to be identified at a distance andlor non-cooperatively.\n\nVideo Motion Detect\nThe most basic form of recognition, VMD identifies movement of objects\nwithin a specified field of view. The movement is detected as a change\nwithin the scene and an alarm triggered. Because of this, current VMD\nsystems have a tendency to have a high level of false alarms. Autonomy\nVirage offers improved VM D capabilities which go beyond simple detection\nof movement by identifying the elements within the video that have\nmoved and only triggering alarms when appropriate. The VMD system can\ntherefore be set to alert when pedestrians are walking down a motorway\nalerting supervisors to the fact that there may be a safety issue. By identifying\npedestrians moving we are able to investigate and take action quickly.\n\nOptical Character Recognition\nNeural Network (NN) based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques lie at the heart of Autonomy Virage's video\ncapabilities, supporting advanced character recognition in all conditions, providing much greater tolerance for matching\npoorly defined characters. Fully automated OCR in conjunction with Autonomy Virage's high quality recording of digital\nvideo images, offers users the ability to centralize all of their data and cross-reference it in order to repurpose the\ninformation quickly and efficiently for further analysis.\n\n\fObject Tracking\nIn addition to identifying objects, Autonomy Virage can track objects entirely automatically between multiple cameras.\nWhile an object remains in a field of view, it is tracked automatically using the coordinate information to control a Pan Tilt\nZoom (PTZ) camera.\n\nObject Sizing\nDetecting the size of an object or a group of objects in a field of view alerts surveillance staff to situations which may require\na response. For example, where Autonomy Virage's technology is used for monitoring traffic flow, the detection of a traffic jam\nimmediately alerts the, surveillance staff and, if necessary, an additional lane could be opened to ease congestion.\n\nAnalyze & Respond\nAutonomy Virage automatically monitors large volumes of video surveillance and feeds\nhighly-targeted information to investigators in real-time, ensuring that threats are\nidentified immediately and responded to rapidly.\n\nConfiguration and Training\nAs each surveillance and monitoring environment is unique, Autonomy Virage gives organizations the flexibility to set and\nrefine their own definitions as to what behavior could constitute a potential security threat and also define the precise action\nto be taken once a potential threat has been correctly identified. Training and configuring an Intelligent Scene Analysis\nSystem (iSAS) does not require any specialist input from Autonomy Virage and may be performed by any system operator.\nUsing an intuitive user interface and live or recorded images, operators can train the system, to recognize unusual behavior\nwhich may present a threat and establish multiple definitions for multiple locations. For example, the user can train the\nsystem to trigger an alert to unattended baggage in the arrivals hall of an airport which would automatically result in a\nprerecorded message over the PA system. Baggage being held by airline staff however would not trigger such a response.\nVirage supports a range of training methods including:\nNon alerting content: where the system is introduced to video containing no specific events.\nAlerting content: involves training the system on specific: events contained within the video.\nSimulating alerts: by inserting objects into the scene which can then be used to generate example events.\nAlert verification: the most sophisticated training procedure consists of using p#-generated alerts in order to\nenhance system training and improve performance. By allocating a series of pre-generated alerts into specific\ncategories, such as examples of suspicious and unsuspicious behavioc the system can be configured to identify\nbehaviors more accurately. Such user verification allows the system to build up a model of known behaviors and\ngives the system greater insight into what constitutes usual and unusual behaviors.\nTo allow organizations to monitor a wide area against a set of diverse criteria, iSAS can be applied to any new or existing\nCCTV system and loaded with different configurations for different cameras or camera positions. Moreover, iSAS can be\nconfigured to identify multiple categories of alarms within a scene at the same time, each with its own set of specified alert\nactions. Other configuration options include masking a scene so that objects within a certain perimeter are not detected,\nmasking alerts generated by any object within a specified area, setting time or occurrence limits on alarms generated per\nincident and full customization of results notification with the inclusion of metadata associated with system, camera, data,\ntime and alarm code.\n\n\fAdvanced Data Analysis and Review\nUnderstanding Brings Recognition\nBy automatically understanding and interpreting large volumes of video, audio and text files, Autonomy's technology\nidentifies what is relevant and allows security personnel to focus on critical activities and confidently make more informed\ndecisions.\n\nMapping and Understanding Events\nAutonomy Virage automates the capture, encoding and indexing of video surveillance, creating\na highly detailed index. This makes it faster and easier for security personnel to find the correct\ninformation needed in order to protect both people and corporate assets.\nContent can be searched simultaneously in any language and any format, wherever it is stored.\nSearch options include: Conceptual Search, Natural Language Retrieval, Query By Example, Refine By Example and\nCross-Language Search. The technology retrieves and returns references to conceptually related information and results are\npresented with summaries and hyperlinks to similar information instantly and automatically.\nExtensive event viewing and searching options include instant plate matching and partial plate matching, as well as a\nfull range of options to search by specific parameters including camera, date, time, alert code, plate and category. Where\nmultiple cameras are in operation, users can search all cameras simultaneously through a single interface, or if desired,\nnarrow their search to results from a specified camera. Users can create 'hot lists' of specified vehicles they wish to track\nclosely and compare any identified numberllicense plate to predefined lists or perform full vehicle and driver database\nmatching in order to match identified vehicles with any entry within the database.\nIf images from an overview camera are available, they can be displayed adjacent to the footage of the number plate\nenabling operators to view driver or vehicle images alongside number plate images. Any metadata that has been included\nin the database entry, such as registered vehicle owner, address or traffic records, is presented alongside each recognized\nnumber plate to enable operators to gain instant visibility into the history of any identified vehicle.\n\nHyperlinking\nThe Hyperlinking feature enables automatic matching and identifying of similar pieces of information. By automatically\nidentifying vital relationships between information, hyperlinking enables intelligent contextual cross-referencing of content\nwithout the need for user input.\nBy completely removing the requirement for manual input through its use of intelligent conceptual and contextual\nassociation, Autonomy ensures the instantly generated links are always up-to-date and highly relevant to users. For\nexample, when monitoring vehicles and containers at a port, the technology can make intelligent associations between\ninformation in a police database, imagery captured by DVRINVR and data monitored by Autonomy to report stolen or\nillegitimate vehicles andlor drivers. Not only are people kept informed of the latest, most relevant information, but content\nduplication, time spent navigating for information, and overall costs are significantly reduced.\n\n30 Technology and Architecture\n\n\fHyperlinking effectively:\nReduces the cost of maintaining unstructured information within any environment\nReduces the time taken to navigate to related information\nReduces duplication of effort\nKeeps people informed and up-to-date\nRetains browsers or consumers on a website through dynamically recommending further content and products\n\nAutomatic Profiling and Personalized Agents\nAutomatic Profiling can be used by organizations to accurately understand individual analysts' (user) interests based on\ntheir history and actions. By generating a multi-faceted conceptual profile of the user, based on explicit profiles (preconfigured agents) and implicit profiles (click-through and submission), the feature creates a very current understanding of\nuser interests without the need for any explicit input on their part. Profiling facilitates and speeds up surveillance operations\nas it enables vital intelligence to be delivered to the user without requiring them to actively search for it.\nPersonalized Agents may be set up to proactively deliver highly relevant, accurate information to users. Agents can be\ntrained to look for conceptually related themes from concepts a user defines either implicitly or explicitly as part of their\nprofile. By continuously monitoring live information streams and matching relevant, conceptually related content against\nprofiles, Agents can uncover data that may potentially hold new significance for intelligence operations, increasing overall\nknowledge and improving response rates. Through its automatic approach, Agents assist surveillance staff to monitor\nactivity and information that may potentially be critical and which might otherwise have been missed or required significant\ninvestigative processes to discover.\n\nClustering & Spectrographs\nAutomatic graphical 2D Clusters and 3D Spectrographs enable organizations\nto analyze large\n- sets of document data, audio or even user-profile\ninformation and automatically identify inherent information clusters, and,\nconsequently trends and themes. Clustering provides organizations with\ninstant high-level visibility of the knowledge base, eliminating knowledge\ngaps and enabling the organization to react quickly where necessary. For\nexample, numberllicense plates captured by ANPR could be clustered and\nmatched against a police database. In this way, potential correlations within\n\n2DClwerMa~\n\ndata - such as repeat offences committed by the same driver attempting to\ndisguise his actions by using different vehicles - could be uncovered and\naction taken to prevent future occurrences of the same instance.\nOther benefits include:\nInstant high-level visibility of the knowledge base\nAutomatic jdentification of information trends and themes\nEliminated knowledge gaps\nOptimized information flow\nAutomatic reaction information changes\n\nAutomatic clustering of communications visualized\nthrough the Spectrograph Pane\n\nTechnology and Architecture 31\n\n\fPowerful visualization tools make it easy for users to understand and interpret data sets. Autonomy provides two intuitive\nJava-based user interfaces to make clusters visible:\n2 0 Cluster Map: used to identify conceptual similarities and differences between clusters and display them in 20.\nBased on Java Server Pages (JSP), the landscape is generated from the interrelationships between clusters and\nthe documents contained within those clusters. Clustering provides a single overview of the clusters contained\nwithin the data, clusters that are close together correlate to higher degrees of similarity, whilst dissimilar clusters\nare situated further apart.\nSpectrograph: this user interface displays the relationship between clusters in successive periods and sets of\ndata. Clusters are presented as a JSP-based 3 0 spectrograph whereby the x-axis represents information over time\n(enabling users to visualize how clusters develop over a given time period), whilst the y-axis represents the range\nof concepts defined within the knowledge base.\n\nAdvanced alerting functionality monitors information in order to automatically and instantly\nalert users to information which may be of interest to them based on their profile or the agents\nthey have set up. For example, if a surveillance officer had set up agents to monitor and deliver\ninformation on a particular suspect, and if the agents detected similarly conceptually related\nactivity being discussed by another person, the system could automatically trigger an alert to this\npotential correlation, Instant alert mechanisms could be web interfaces, e-mails, SMS or digital alarms amongst others.\n\nDatabase Integration\nAutonomy Virage may be configured with existing databases containing vehicle, container,\npersonnel and other information, or configured with a dedicated database.\nA common usage is for plate recognition: once vehicles are entered into the databases, actions\ncan be associated with each plate by assigning a code to each entry. This ensures that once a\nvehicle is correctly identified, pre-defined instructions will be followed. For example, a code can be assigned to authorized\ncars to trigger a barrier to be raised so that authorized vehicles can gain access. Where an unrecognized vehicle is detected,\nthe system could be configured to play a WAV file which would refuse the vehicle entry and trigger a live audiolvideo\nconnection which would be relayed to security staff. Codes and actions may be assigned depending on what time or date\nany given vehicle is identified. In addition, the system may be instructed to record footage of the vehicle and notify the\ndriver's supervisor that they were onsite during the weekend.\nThe list below provides a sample of typical actions upon vehicle recognition:\nRaise barrier\n\nDeny access\n\nChange traffic lights\nDisplay LCD text\nTrigger recording via DVRINVR (includingpre-recording)\nIncrease frame rate for higher quality recording\n\nOpen live videolaudio connection\nAlert superv/sor via SMSlemail\nPlay WAV file\nStore image of vehiclelplateldriver\n\nIf using the dedicated database, records can be individually entered or imported once, or periodically integrated, enabling a\nmass data transfer from the third party system to the Autonomy system.\n\n32 Technology and Architecture\n\nI\n\n\fAudio Processing\nAutonomy Virage speech recognition technology enables security\nfiles in video, radio and telephony systems instantly. Autonomy's\nfundamentally different because it leverages IDOL'Sconceptual understanding of content.\nWhereas other technologies adopt a simple phonetic approach using only acoustic information, Autonomy achieves a\nhigher level of understanding through advanced language modeling.\nLanguage modeling involves concept extraction in conjunction with acoustic-phonetic methods to achieve significantly\ngreater accuracy and better results. Simple acoustic-phonetic methods alone fail to achieve good speech to text translation.\nThe acoustic-phonetic approach cannot differentiate, for example, between \"can I\" and \"can eye\". In this example, where\nthe desired option is \"can I\", Autonomy Virage's speech technologies employ IDOLS intelligent probabilistic language\nmodeling to understand the context of what is being said and in this way select the appropriate option \"can I.\"\nVirage's audio recognition functionality includes:\nSpeaker independence: the system is trained on a large balanced corpus of data encompassing many different\nvariables such as different accents or male-female pitch and tone. This means the acoustic models are speaker\nindependent The solution works out-of-the-box with no manual training, although customization for specific\naccents or speakers can be done.\nExtensive vocabularies: there is no arbitrary limit on vocabulary sine\nSpeaker identification: audio recognition can be trained to enable individual speakers to be identified\nWord spotting and phrase recognition: audio can be searched by standard keyword as well as conceptual\nmethods. Conceptual searching returns references to conceptually related information ranked by relevance or\ncontextual distance.\nPatented Autonomy technology: reduces CPU and memory usage for increased speed of operations and improved\nperformance\nSupport for both high quality audio such as broadcast and telephony\n\n\f\fDigital Security\nInternal threats, the risk of industrial espionage and the increased value of\ndigital assets such as computer code or HD film footage mean that logical and\nphysical security requirements cannot be separate strategies or systems. They\nneed to be converged and they need to refer to the operational systems used by\nthe business as well.\nAutonomy is unique in its ability to provide a single information infrastructure\nthat can manage the lifecycle of all information assets, including how they\nchange and who has interacted with them, across all the views of business (operational, compliance, security). Autonomy's\nbroad Meaning Based Computing can link into every repository and data source within the organization and ensure the\nbusiness information is processed, understood and acted upon.\nMaintaining security and ensuring only authorized personnel gain access to sensitive data is key to almost every\norganization. Increasingly complex IT environments mean there are often several systems in place each requiring a different\nset of authentication procedures. Virage's infrastructure exactly mirrors the security entitlement required to deliver the right\ninformation to the right people according to who is entitled to see it. The World's largest and most secure intelligence\norganizations have deployed Autonomy to safeguard their most sensitive information assets.\nAutonomy Virage is unique in its approach to managing and maintaining security and is able to seamlessly integrate with\nexisting third party systems whilst respecting existing security. Advanced methodologies for, user authentication, data\nprotection and verification ensure the right people have access to legitimate data. In addition, advanced functions such\nas mapping significantly improve system performance within even the largest, most complex environments. These unique\nadvantages make it the number one choice for many leading organizations today.\n\nIntellectual Asset Protection System (IAS)\nThe world's largest and most secure intelligence organizations have deployed Autonomy's Intellectual Asset Protection\nSystem (IAS) Connectors to safeguard their most sensitive information assets. Autonomy provides all aspects of security\nmanagement, including front-end user authentication, back-end entitlement checking and secure encrypted communication\nbetween the IDOL Server and its client applications with 128-bit Block Tiny Encryption Algorithm (BTEA). IDOL'S mapped\nsecurity model is the only empirically proven index security model.\n\n\fAutonomy's Unique IAS Mapped Security\nOnly Autonomy offers mapped security - a highly configurable, secure, accurate, and fast method for respecting third\nparty security entitlements. Existing security, including permissions based security, is mapped directly to the l DOL engine,\nencrypted, and stored. As a result, IDOL does not need to send any requests across the network to the data stores\nwhen building up a results list. What the user is allowed to see is assessed inline within the IDOL kernel at speeds that\nexceed the response times of the native repository. Unlike other techniques, the security model is never out of date as\nthe transitional signaling mechanism within the connector layer informs IDOL in real-time of any updates or permission\nchanges.\nSince IDOL'Sarchitecture is inherently modular by design, it requires multiple subsystems to communicate with each other,\noften across insecure networks. All communication between these processes may be encrypted (Secure Sockets Layer), so\nthat packet sniffers who are able to break past a firewall are unable to read the content of traffic between IDOL modules.\nAll of the system's modules are capable of operating in a secure communications mode providing, at minimal processing\noverhead, the protection of 128-bit encryption. Additionally, IDOL can leverage SSL for both aggregation and querying of\ncontent, including access to SSL encrypted sites.\nAsset scalability through Mapped Security\nGroup membership scalability through Group Servers\nOperational granularity via a Document-centric model enabling secure real time operation and total flexibility over\nyour security policies\n\nMapped Security\n\nm\n\nData\nRepositories\n\nGroup\nServers\n\nI\n\n\n.\n\nIDOL\n\nLibraries\n\n\fSecure Data Authentication and Personnel Verification\nExtensive user authentication, data protection and verification procedures make Virage suitable for the most demanding\nsecurity and surveillance environments. Virage can provide all aspects of security management including document and\nintra-document access control against user, group and role level entitlement; this ensures only authorized personnel gain\naccess to sensitive data. Encrypted inter-machine and intra-process communication protocols are woven into the fabric of\nVirage's modular design at a fundamental level, providing secure transmission of information throughout the architecture. In\naddition, Virage ensures the integrity of all data captured is preserved through results encryption and image watermarking.\nFull audit tracking enables authorized personnel to gain immediate visibility into the history associated with any record in\nthe system.\n\nArchiving\nHistorically, the challenges and costs of storage for high quality audio and video meant that archiving assets only took\nplace if required by corporate regulations or law. Autonomy's consolidated archive is now a viable option for the long-term\nstorage and management of surveillance assets. The Autonomy consolidated archive is the first and only solution with the\nfunctional~ty,performance and scalability needed to address the requirements of collecting, consolidating, making available\nand ultimately destroying information from multiple proprietary systems, in numerous languages and hundreds of different\ncontent formats, in order to prepare the infrastructure for upcoming regulatory and legal challenges.\nThe unique architecture of the IDOL platform ensures that the search, management and retrieval of content are as scalable\nand high performing as the archival process. This allows for legacy C C N footage, and processed alerts to be crossreferenced and used for ongoing investigations or as part of a complaint or insurance process.\n\nRecording and Retrieval\nAutonomy Virage supplies and supports the full range of analogue and digital video sources,\nallowing your organization to realize even greater value from its entire existing infrastructure.\nAs an integral part of crime control policy, social control theory and community\nconsciousness, CCTV is a defining feature of today's society and a powerful tool used\nby corporations and governments worldwide. High quality digital and network recording\nfacilities are a critical component of any successful CCTV strategy to ensure that potentially\nvital images are captured and retained safely for further analysis. While CCTV footage is\npopularly believed to play an important role in crime detection and prevention, in order for\na system to be truly effective, robust recording equipment is a priority.\nMoreover, simply capturing and storing images indiscriminately does not, in itself, constitute an effective solution;\nrecording technologies which merely capture and store footage fall desperately short of the levels of complexity required\nby most security and surveillance environments. Autonomy Virage's Digital and Network Video Recorders (DVRINVR) offer\norganizations state of the art recording technology together with advanced retrieval functionality for rapid image recall to\nensure that key images can be located quickly and easily for further analysis.\n\n,*.\",..'\n*'.,..,\n\na:;::\n*-.v*.,\nITEI!!?\n,.*S\n\nU'\n\n\fBringing fresh intelligence to digital and network recording and transmission,\nAutonomy Virage's DVRINVR is sophisticated enough to alter its function in\nresponse to changing circumstances and distinguish between different types of\nbehavior and alarm. With a totally flexible system configuration and a storage\ncapacity expanding into petabytes, DVRINVR can be tailored for the widest\nrange of applications, and its ability to record at full resolution across multiple\nchannels and prioritize its activity dynamically, really does make Autonomy\nVirage a new breed of DVRINVR.\n\nDynamic Resources Prioritization\nSurveillance staff can link straight to live images from multiple cameras and locations linked to a DVRINVR unit. All\nimages captured and retained by DVRINVR resolve fine detail and allow users accessing images, either on the fly or in\nretrospect, to analyze detailed, high resolution images.\nUnlike other systems which require extensive configuration by an administrator or are limited to one simple recording\noption, Autonomy Virage DVRINVR is entirely flexible and can perform multiple recording functions simultaneously and\nreconfigure itself dynamically based on an alarm. Increasing the frame recording rate, switching between cameras or\nswitching between storage buffer types, ensures resources are prioritized dynamically according to demand. In order to\nensure a commitment to recording and storing high quality images likely to be required for post event analysis, cameras\nmay be configured to change their frame recording rate according to certain pre-defined conditions. For example, when\nintegrated with Intelligent Scene Analysis System (ISAS), if certain activity is detected within the field of view, such as\nsomeone leaving a bag unattended, DVRINVR can be programmed to react to this alarm and automatically increase the\nrecording frame rate prior to, during and after the event.\nVideo Motion Detection: DVRINVR can be configured to react once motion is detected within a specified scene or\nparticular area within a scene\nDigital: these can be generated by physical movements including the opening of a barrier or door; when such\nmovement is detected, DVRINVR can be configured to respond automatically\nTime multiplexing: using the VMD capabilities on every I P camera feed, Autonomy Virage can optimize the use\nof advanced iSAS analytics as and when a situation dictates. This way TCO can be improved while all video feeds\nare effectively monitored\nSurveillance alarms: when integrated with other systems such as ANPR or iSAS, pre-defined alarms are\nautomatically relayed to the DVRINVR unit to ensure appropriate images are captured and stored upon\nrecognition of certain vehicles or behaviors\n\nStorage Capacity and Principles\nAutonomy Virage ensures that storage requirements are actively managed for optimum performance by automatically\noverwriting all captured images after a specified time.\nAutonomy Virage's DVRINVR offers extensive storage capabilities and hard disk drive (HDD) capacity which can be\nadapted to suit individual project requirements. While storage costs have decreased significantly in recent years, and\nAutonomy continues to lead the market in providing comprehensive storage facilities, in most circumstances, it is neither\nnecessary nor desirable to store large quantities of irrelevant video footage.\n\n\fDVRJNVR can be configured to prioritize the storage of images accordingly. All images are stored to a HDD which is\nintegrated within each DVRJNVR unit. The system uses HDD circular buffers working on a first-in first-out (FIFO) principle\nto ensure that there is always storage capacity available for new images. Buffer size determines the maximum length of\nstorage period available, so by using multiple buffers of differing sizes, images can be stored for different lengths of time.\nAutonomy Virage can record and store all background images routinely for a specified time, e.g. for 7 days or 30 days,\ndepending on buffer size. When required, Autonomy Virage can also store footage from immediately before, during and/\nor after an event on a separate buffer so that it is available for retrospective analysis. If policies dictate C&C can be used\nto automatically manage the longer-term archiving, retrieval and disposition of important video footage so that it can be\n\nutilized as a potential asset for years in the future.\nStorage levels are automatically monitored to make sure that all necessary images are captured and archived correctly.\nShould storage be consumed faster than expected, either as a result of a higher than expected number of events or due to\na miscalculation, the user will be automatically alerted to this in order to ensure that images may be continually recorded\nand stored according to requirements. In order to increase the amount of images stored within any given DVR system,\nthe compression level of images may be modified at any time, thereby making the system extremely flexible to changing\nrequirements.\nPre-event recording can be triggered to ensure that images which precede a significant event can be appropriately captured\nand stored for later analysis. These storage techniques ensure that all images surrounding potentially significant activity can\nbe kept without the need for extensive storage capacity.\nPredefined events can be configured to increase the recording frame rate on key words or hard wired alarm inputs. HDD\nperformance remains unaffected by both search and playback features. The storage capacity of the installed system will\ndetermine how long images are kept. In addition, limits can be set on individual users to\nlimit how far back they are able to search through footage.\n\n\fConcl usion\nSecurity and surveillance operations are widely regarded as an integral and essential\npart of today's society. As organizations at all levels, ranging from law enforcement\nagencies and governments to large corporations and public bodies seek to enhance\nthe security and safety of assets and personnel, security and surveillance technologies\nare an increasingly commonplace and necessary part of our daily lives. Growing\ndemands to protect public safety, buildings and commercial assets accentuate the\nneed for robust security and surveillance solutions in a wide range of environments.\nConsequently, surveillance techniques are increasingly prevalent, especially in many\nEuropean countries where CCTV systems are now extremely customary. While CCTV\ncameras in themselves do much to establish public and corporate confidence, the\neffectiveness of such systems when used in isolation is often limited. Organizations seeking to implement a truly effective\nand responsible security and surveillance strategy must consider embracing additional systems such as EPOS, CSM, ANPR,\niSAS and BIS as well as addressing the way in which data and images obtained from such techniques are recorded and\nstored. Furthermore, as security requirements become increasingly complex and threats posed to individuals, corporations\nand nations more sophisticated, it is ever more critical that organizations gain a holistic view of their security and\nsurveillance procedures.\nThe ability to correlate and cross reference data gained from multiple applications such as ANPR and iSAS with other\nsources allows organizations to adopt an intelligence led approach to security and surveillance operations. Autonomy\nVirage offers a comprehensive solution which enables organizations to implement key solutions for specific requirements\nand support the overall objectives of their security and surveillance strategy. By incorporating core IDOL technology,\nAutonomy Virage Security and Surveillance is able to automatically understand and interpret the potential significance of\nmultiple pieces of security data, and correlate that information with other known intelligence to enable organizations to\nimplement comprehensive security and surveillance solutions. Autonomy Virage's unique approach brings new visibility\nand intelligence to security and surveillance operations and equips organizations with the technology they need in order to\nsafeguard public, private and corporate assets and respond effectively to security threats today and in the future.\nTrusted by key law enforcement agencies, governments, retailers and major transport service providers, Autonomy Virage\nsignificantly complements all surveillance operations.\n\n\"Because it's being used in a legal application, there was a majorfocus on usi\nsofhvare product that ensures reliable result$.

Kudyan PhD\n\nBvs Senior RF Designer\n\nC(,\n\nDerrick Kerley\nBvs E M 3 Sales Manager\n\nHow Does One Find Them?\n\nPUS DECT 6.0 Iifil+rat1\n\nIntroduction\nUse of DECT 6.0 phones in Europe by U.S. expatriates has been noticed to cause significant interference in the up-link bands of the European UMTS licensed services. This paper discusses the problem\nand proposes a detection-based strategy for preventing such use of\nDECT 6.0 phones. The proposed approach consists of monitoring and\nlocating such phones, thereby helping network operators minimize\nincremental operating costs due to interference. The technologies for\nrealizing this are relatively simple and in existence today. Monitoring\nrecords of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) already compile lists of\nsuch sources within each cell that can be traced to neighborhoods or\ncity blocks. The technology for the actual location of DECT 6.0 phones\n(as well as cell phones) is also in existence. A family of such devices\nis produced by Berkeley Varitronics Systems in Metuchen, New Jersey, consisting of, among others, a scanning narrow-band receiver\nequipped with a multi-band high-gain directional antenna capable\nof guiding the user to within an arm's reach of the culprit phone(s).\n\nDiscussion of the Problem\nThe Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunicationsstandard, better\nknown as DECT, was developed by ETSl in Europe. It is used for creating cordless phone systems primarily for homes and small offices.\nDECT phones have been developed and marketed in Europe, Australia, South America and North America. The introduction of the DECT\nstandard to North America was delayed because U.S. FCC regulations required a slightly different frequency allocation. This resulted\nin the development of the DECT 6.0 standard for North America which\nassigned the 1920-1930 MHz band to cordless phone voice channels\nonly. As a result, DECT 6.0 phones are highly immune to interference\nfrom other wireless applications (e.g., baby monitors, wireless networks, etc.). The frequency allocations for DECT, DECT 6.0 and UMTS\nup link bands in the E.U. and North America are listed in Table 1:\nTable 1. DECT, DECT 6.0 and UMTS Up-link Frequency Allocations for\nEurope and North America\n\nThe careful frequency allocation of DECT and DECT 6.0 phones in\nthe E.U. and North America assures that these phones will neither\ncause nor be susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)\nwith respect to other licensed wireless services, as long as the\nphones are deployed in their respective geographic region(@ for\nwhich they were designed for. However, when DECT 6.0 phone systems are deployed in the E.U., their RF signals can interfere with\nsome of the up-link channels of European UMTS services because\nthe two bands overlap (see Table 1). DECT 6.0 systems are particularly potent EM1 sources for several reasons:\n1. The system uses the same frequency band (1920-1930MHz) for\nboth of its uplink and downlink channels.\n\n2. All handsets and base unit will contribute to the cumulative level\nof EM1 simultaneously.\n3. Except for the few \"green\" versions, most DECT systems keep\nthe RF signal always on.\n4. Unlike cell phones, the RF output level from cordless phones and\nbase is fixed.\n\nAccording to some European network operators, a signal level of\nonly -97 dBm or higher in the UMTS uplink band is considered as\ninterference. If the UMTS phone(s) are located within the confines\nof the same city block, transmission(s) from a DECT 6.0 phone can\nvery easily exceed this threshold. This may be demonstrated by\nconsidering the estimated free-space path loss for electromagnetic\n\n\fwaves, as a function of distance d\n\n6.0 phones purchased cheaply on-line. According to some wireless\noperators in the U.K., sites where this kind of interference is occurring right now is readily identified from BTS records for each cell.\n\nwhere do and dl represent the transmit and receive antenna positions\nrespectively in the same units of length. Thus, signals originating\nfrom a DECT phone located 1 meter from a point of reference to a\npoint 1 Kilometer from the same point of reference would attenuate\nby 60dB. If the RF power level near the antenna was -10dBm (this is\na conservative output level for a typical cordless phone) the DECT 6.0\nuplink signal level has the potential to exceed the -97dBm threshold\nover an area equivalent to a small city block or over an apartment\ncomplex with hundreds of residents only after allowing for propagation loss as well as attenuation caused by typical obstacles (walls,\ndoors, trees, etc) between the DECT phone and the point of observation. Other wireless devices do not present the same type of challenge as a result of their inherent operating schemes (see Table 2).\n\nProposedSolution\n\nTable 2. Relative Likelihood of Interference from Different Devices\n\nI\n\ni\nDevice\ni\n'\n\nCell Phones\n\nWiFi Access Point\n\nr-\n\nThe risk of interference from cell phones t\nUMTS services is insignificant. The cell phon\nflrmware must first passively detect the local\ncell BTS and recognize it as a \"valid\" host.\nThen it will attempt to register over a channel\nassigned by the BTS.

Wolfhound) Cell Phone\nDetector 'Sniffs Out' Contraband Cell Phones in Maryland Prison.\nFive smuggled cell phones discovered during a two-hour sweep of Maryland3 Department of Public Safety & Correctional Services facility\n\n-- --\n\nMETUCHEN, W, April 14, 2010\nBerkeley Varitronics Systems, Inc. (BVS), a leading provider of advanced wireless solutions and products to the domestic and\ninternational wireless telecommunications industry, recently showcased the Bloodhound Cell Detector at the GovSec Show in Washington, DC March 23nl.\n\nI\n\nA live Bloodhound demonstration at the show was made to Mr. Jay Miller, DOC IT Manager for Maryland's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. A\nfield trial was scheduled that same evening to fully test a Bloodhound in a Maryland correctional facility. A team of correctienal officers were assembled to execute\na cell phone confiscation operation during the evening hours of Tuesday, March 23,2010 accompanied by Mr. Miller.\nDi the five confiscated cell phones, two were on an active voice calk, one was being used for text m-ging,\nand two were hidden on mndby mode. One of the\nhidden phones was in a hollowed out brick covered by a capstone in a low wall that separates bunks areas in a dormitory. The second was inside an electrical box that\nhad been covered up with a solid utility plate, which was held In place with security screws.\n\nI\n\n''It took only two hours to find five cell phones that were either in use at the time or hidden in the jail cells on standby mode ready to take calls,\" said Jay Miller.\n\n\"Based on these results we plan to place additional orders for the Bloodhound cell phone detector,\" added the Assistant Commissioner of the Maryland Dlvlsion of\nCorrections, Mr. Gary Hornbaker.\n\nAs a wireless, handheld device, the Bloodhound Is a safe, legal (Bloodhound does not use jamming which is a violation of FCC rules), quick and cost-effective way\nto monitor and pinpoint unauthorized cell phones within comctional facilities 24 hours a day. The complete Bloodhound unit costs $1,800, whlch is much less than\nother solutions that may require an entire network infrastructure to be installed. The device can also be utilized by any government agency or organization that wants\nto enforce a 'no wireless policy'. This can also include schools, hospitals, airliners, etc.\n\n\"It took only two hours\nto find five cell phones\ndhat were eMer in use\nat the time or hidden\nin the jail cells on\nstandby mode ready to\ntake'calls.'\"\nJay Miller\nOOC IT hlalagsr\n\nof PuMlc\n\nMaryland\n\nSafety & carsetional Senlcw\n\nis\n\nshown\n\nwith included\n\nl\n\nDF\n(Direction\nFinding) antenno\nideal for detecting and pin\npointing contraband phones.\n\nSubject: Thanks for s u ~ ~ o r t i the\nn e eauioment for testine of Cell Phone Detector\n\nTo Manager of lnfoleader Co., Ltd., Thailand and Berkeley Varitronics\nSystem, INC., USA\nDue to Department of Corrections of Thailand (DOC) having strong\nrequirement to look for the qualified cell phone detector device to search for the\nillegal cell phone used in the prisons, lnfoleader Co., Ltd. together with Berkeley\nVaritronics System, INC., USA have proposed Bloodhound for such purpose. The\npresentation has been performed on 16 July 2010 at DOC Headquarter, from 13:oo\nto 15:oo. The corresponding demonstration of the device is also taken place to\ndescribe the feature and capabilities of the system. Explicitly, the result of the\ndemonstration and the test are very good by finding the hidden cell phone in the\nroom effectively.\nMoreover, the DOC officers had invited the team to do the actual field test\nat the real prison. So,on the same day at 18:00, the team together with DOC officer\nhave entered into Bang Kwang Central Prison, one of the most critical prisons in\nthe country. The joint team had selected to inspect zone# 5 and start using the\ndevice to detect whether there were any cell phone in that area. The result\nsurprised everyone. With only 30 minutes of the operation, the device could detect\nmany cell phones and identify the positions which led the team to find 10 mobile\nphones. Everyone in the team were very happy with such excellent result and plan\nto make the complete report to the upper executive level. This can prove that the\nproposed device is very capable to work as the key device to detect the cell phone\nin the prisons in Thailand.\nIn summary, Bang Kwang Central Prison would like to thank lnfoleader Co.,\nLtd. and Berkeley Varihonics System, INC. to provide us such great device and\nfantastic support for cell phone detection test. This device can really help us to\nimprove all the related cell phone checking process. We hope that we can work\nclosely with your company in the near future.\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"With only 30 minutes of the operation,\nthe devlce can detect many cell phones\nand identify the positions which led the\nteam to find 10 mobile phones. Everyone\nin the team were very happy with such\nexcellent result and plan to make the\ncomplete report to the upper executive\nlevel. Thls can prove that the proposed\ndevice is very capable to work as the key\ndevice to detect the cell phone in the\nprisons in Thailand.\"\n\nVisanu Prachongkit\nBangkwang Prison Commander\nThailand\n\nMr. Visanu Prachongkit\nBangkwang Prison Commander\n\n\f",

Customers can easily deploy the Bivio NCCS\nto provide highly programmable traffic enforcement and web content\ncontrol functionality to immediately protect and optimize their fixed\nand mobile network communications infrastructure.\n\nI\n\n/\n\n----\n\nwww.bivio.net\n\n\fBivio Network Content Control System\nj\n\nBusiness Enterprise\n\nA\n\ni\n!\n\nUlond\nPT*\n\n4.\n\n*\n\nRan*ted\n\nlPTni6c\n\nFixed Subscriber Access\n\nj\n\n..................................................\n\nj MobileSubscriber Access [\n\nGGSNI\n\nPDSN\n\n7heBivioNreS does nor requireany netwwk infrmrraure madificationfwWorm&h\nnerwwk Depoyedin-line, thetheCSis nompomta the nerwork and m- that is, naP\naddre35 isoddresmbk m the IPdatopanh, with noperibnnoneedegra&im to the m.\n\nM\n\nNetwork-Based Web Content Control\nand Traffic Enforcement\n\nFlowlnspectmDPI Engine - The Foundationfor\nIP Traffic Monitoring & Control\n\nManaging today's complex network infrastructure presents many\nchallenges to network and security administrators.First, they must\neffectively manage the continued growth in bandwidth-consumingIP\ncommunications (such as general InterneWebsite traffic, Peer-to-Peer\n(PZP) file transfers, Skyper Instant Messaging (IM), VolP, and YouTube)\ntraversing their networks. Furthermore, they must ensure that IP\ntraffic moving across the network complies with various regulatory or\norganization-approved network communication policies. Finally, since\nthis same traffic often contains policy-prohibitedcontent as well as\nmalicious data (such as viruses, worms, phishing and other malware),\nnetwork administrators must minimizethe impact of cyber security\nthreats.\n\nAt the core of the Bivio NCCS is a powerful and innovative deep packet\ninspection (DPI) engine, which leverages Bivio's long and successful\nhistory of combining complex processing at very high networking\nspeeds with unlimited flexibility. These technologies enable full\nprotocol and user awareness, along with fine-grained application\nand content differentiation.In addition, the DPI engine is used to\nprovide auto-discovery of user-authentication protocols, eliminating\nthe need to make external calls to provisioningservers, thereby\ngreatly simplifying the deployment and management of the system.\nThe result is a unique and powerful system that can be deployed\ninline to perform packet inspection, web content control and traffic\nenforcement on a completely standalone basis.\n\nIf left unchecked, overall network performance is reduced, content\nmanagement and control is diminished and there is increased\nvulnerability to cyber security attacks.\nResponding to these challenges, the Bivio NCCS is the industry's\nleading integrated policy-based monitoring, content control and traffic\nenforcement solution. The NCCS is a standalone networking system\nthat enables customers to provide granular web filtering and traffic\nenforcement on a per-protocol, per-flow, and per-user basis, all without\nrequiring interaction with external devices.\n\nWeb Content Control with True HTlP Filtering\nThe Bivio NCCS provides an advanced lnternet filtering solution that\nnot only includes traditional URL filtering but also protects the network\ncommunications infrastructurefrom malware and other emerging\nthreats. NCCS includes mechanisms to control access to improper\ncontent, peer-to-peer (P2P) and chat usage, and other Web-centric\napplications.\n\n\fc\n\nReal time actionable intelligence\n\nThe Bivio Data Retention System (DRS) is a high-performancedata\ncollection and retention system that allows network operators and government agencies to strengthen cyber security operations across fixed\nand mobile network infrastructures.The system correlates network flow\nrecords with online and offline data sources to provide contextualized\ninformation intelligence which cyber analysts can use to detect and\nrespond to complex security threats.\nBivio DRS provides a key piece of a comprehensive cyber investigative\nstrategy, enabling investigators to rapidly detect, analyze and react to\ncomplex security threats originating from or traversing the cyber realm.\nThrough the integration of extremely efficient multi-domain record\ncorrelation technology, Bivio DRS delivers actionable intelligence that\nfar exceeds the capabilities of existing data recording and packet\ncapture systems.\n\nI\n\nScalable Architecture\nBivio DRS uses a distributed scalable architectureto\nmanage high volume data collection.The system\n\nconsists of five different functional elements:\nMulti-domain network probe with DPI-based data\nextraction engine\nSecure, high-performanceData Collection and\nCorrelation (DCC) engine\nPerformance-optimized Record Database and\nStorageWriter (RDSW) module\nSynchronized Session Presence and Tracking (SPT)\nengine\nSecure Management and Reporting (SMR) interface\nBivio DRS integrates directly with industry-leading\nnetwork storage systems to maximize deployment\n. .\noptions.\n\nBivio DRS Features\nReal-time multi-source record correlation\n10 Gbps DPI-based network probing enabling\napplication and user context extraction\n\nMobile-specific protocol support (WiMax, 3G. 4Gl\nLTE) for wireless network integration\nHigh-performance record database\nExternal interfaces for custom data mining and\nevent triggering\n\nMULE-SOURCE\nUnt DB\n\nGLo-\n\nCyber Analyst\n\nwww.bivio.net\n\n\fBivio DRS Architecture\n\nRecord Database and StorageWriter (RDSW)\nThe multr-drmenslonal datasets created by the DCC are collected and\nsecurely stored by the Record Database and StorageWriter (RDSW)\nmodule using high-capacity data storage algorrthms that are optimized\nfor fast search and retrieval.This module is personalized to integrate\ndrrectly with rndustly-leading network storage systems to offer flexible\ndeployment options.\n\nExisting cyber investigative data retention solutions focus primarily\non collecting data from a specific source, for example call data records\n(CDRs), IP data records (IPDRs) or server activrty logs. Through their inherently linear nature, these existing solut~onslrmit the ability of network\nanalysts to develop a complete view of activity and potential threats\nData retentron solutions that are designed to record or collect as\nmuch networkdata as possible result in storlng enormous amounts\nof unrelated, sequential flow data This leaves network analysts with\nt h e task of sorting through rec~rdsto\nfind relevant or related communication streams, a process which can consume weeks of intense\ninvestigative effort.\n\nSession Presence and Tracking (SPT)\nThe Bivio DRS Sesslon Presence and Tracking (SPT) engine provides\noverall synchronizat~onof the communrcation sessrons and informatron\ndatasets The SPT engrne allows admrnistrators to implement retention\narchivrng, protection and deletion policies for overall system and storage\nmanagement.\n\nIn contrast to the existing solutions, Bivio DRS is able to correlate and\nstore structured data. Bivio's rnnovative technology lrnks related pieces\nof data t o form a single record that represents the full context of the\ncollected information.This information enables rich data mining for\npowerful cyber rnvestigative operatrons.\n\nSecure Management and Reporting (SMR)\nBrvio DRS IS managed through the Secure Management and Reporting\n(SMR) interface. This function provides access to Bivio DRS data and\nreports based on user and group level privileges, rncluding system-level\nauthorizatron and auditing capabilrties.\n\nMulti-domain network probe\nA core component of Bivio DRS is a 10 Gbps network probe that utilizes\na hlgh-performance layer 7 engrne to extract key flow information including speclfic user, protocol and application information. Bivio network\nprobes can be drstributed across multiple domains, supporting both\nwired and mobrle (WiMax, 3G, 4G/LTE) protocols, to broaden the scope\nof investigatrve actrvity.\n\nDynamic Triggering\nIn addition to providing historical analysis of retained usage data, Bivio\nDRS includes innovative dynamic triggering technology that can initiate real-time actions throughout the collection, storage and retrieval\nprocess. This powerful capability is easily customized using an open\nscrrpting mechanrsm, and can immediately alert analysts or enable\ninstant threat mltigatron action based upon the real-time front-end\ndata collectron process.\n\nData Collection and Correlation (DCC)\nThe Data Collection and Correlation (DCC) engine performs several critical functions In the Blvro DRS lncludlng aggregating flow records from\nmultrple data sources and creating context-based data relationships\nof the user activity streams.The formation of these datasets provrdes\ninformation-rich intelligence that optimrzes the retention and analysis\nfunctrons of the system\n\nF\n\n-=.>-\n\n>\n\n- - - A\n\nBivio DRS Delivers Actionable Intelligence\nThe Bivio Data Retention System empowers cyber analysts to leverage\ncontextualized information faster than ever before through real time\ndata collection and correlation.This ability enables government authorities such as law enforcement (LEA) and public safety agencies to rapidly\ndetect, analyze and react to cyber security threats.\n\n-.-\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-\n\n. -\n\nAbout Bivio Networks\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-- -\"ll-f-:.:g\n\n*\n\nS\n\nz\n\nP\n\nBrvio Networks is a leading provrder of network systems for securing, monltorrng and controlling crrt~calnetwork\ninfrastructure.Bivro's global customer base includes worldwide government agencies and service provrders.

The basic function of CIG is to bind specific\ninterfaces to classification policies and distribute incom~ngtraffic to the\nassigned computational resources according to the classif~cation.\nIn the\nexample diagram, IP traffic 1s classified into two groups whrch are then\nload balanced among a dedicated Inspection Group, or group of Application Processors. Different applications or configurations can be run\non different Inspection Groups, allowing complete flexibility in applying\nthe platform's resourcesto different tasks.\n,,--Trallic Sets\n\n\\\n\nInspectionGroup l\n\n-,\n\nParallel-Processing with Packet Copy: Sometimes,different applications need to inspect the same packet, but would normally experience\nresource contention when running on the same processor or shared\nmemory.The Bivio platform avoids these resource contentions by\ncopying packets in hardware to parallel applications without sacrificing\nthroughput or latency. The scalable processing architecture ensures\nsufficient resources for each application even at full line rate processing.\nNetwork-LayerCPU-Offload: In this mode the Application decides\nwhich flows to process at the Application Layer and which ones to offload to the programmable Network Layer. This functionality significantly\nincreases the effective capacity of the devlce. For latency sensitive traffic\nlike VolP and multimedia, applications can tap into control flows whlle\ndata flows get forwarded on an accelerated inline path through the network layer, thereby keeping data path latencies at an absolute minimum.\n\nBivio APls\nBIVIO APls enable system developers to utilize several advanced capabilities\nof the Bivio architecture as well as offer unique value-added capabilities for\ncustom product differentiation. Bivio APls include advanced capabilities for\ntraffic modes, system scaling, management and high availability functions\non the Bivio network appliance.\n\nManagement\nThe Bivio platform supports a command line interface (CLI) as well as\na web-based graphical user interface (GUI).The Biv~oCL1 provides autocompletion, tab completion, command history and context-sensitivehelp.\n\nAdvanced Modes\nThe default operation of the Bivio network appliance is to load balance\nall traffic from the network interfaces across all Application Processors.\nAlthough this configuration is sufficient for many Inline and transparent\nnetwork applications, the Bivio platform can be easily configured to\nsupport advanced network operations in multiple traffic modes.\n\nlnline Tap Mode: In this mode, the platform operates as a transparent\ninline devlce while packets are belng copled from the \"wire\" to the\napplication. Therefore, packets can be sniffed at wire speed and\nwithout the need for mirror-portson a switch.\n\nManaging the Blvio platform through a web GUI is accomplished by\nusing the Bivio Systems Management Center (SMC). Bivio SMC is a\ncomprehensive centralized management system that simplifies the\ndeployment and maintenance of Bivio platforms and cyber security\nsolutions. Fully-integratedas a hardened, rack mount appliance, the Bivio\nSMC provides complete Fault, Configuration,Accounting, Performance\nand Security (FCAPS) functionality for network administrators to easily\nmanage and maintain any number of Bivio systems using a highly scalable\nclient/server architecture.\n\n\fSystem Architecture\nThe Bivlo 7000 Serles platform family includes two main product groups,\nthe Bivio 7100 and Bivio 7500. All platforms employ a common system\narchltecture that IS optimized by model for a range of performance tiers.\nThe major hardware features include a multi-threaded network processor,\nmultlple dual-core application processors, high-capacity Network Interface Modules (NIMs), and a high-performance commun~cationfabric\nthat accommodates full wire-speed data rates between processors\nThe separation of applicat~on-levelprocessrng from network layer\nprocessing is fundamental to the Bivlo system archltecture. All platform\nmodels Include a high-performance Network Processor Card (NPC)\nfeaturing a multi-core, XLR\" Processor that provides hardware packet\nmanipulation at llne rate for all packet sizes A standard Linux execution\nenvironment allows applications to easily leverage performanceenhancing functions of the Network Processor such as fast path\nacceleration, or blocking of packets at the network layer. In addition,\nthe NPC implements system management functronallty through a\ndedicated processor that communicates to all processors on a private\ncontrol network.\nApplication Processors (APs) In the platform archltecture are fully\nparallellzed CPU subsystems that host Linux networking applicatlon(s)\nEach AP subsystem employs dual-core processor technology deslgned\nso that each processor core includes independent memory and offload\nacceleration slots. Two dual-core APs are Included on the NPC board,\nand Bivio 7500 models allow performance scaling by addlng Application\nProcessor Cards (APCs) to provide an additional four APs per APC to\nthe platform through the high-performance fabric interconnect.\nBivio 7000 Series platforms support dual redundant hot-swap power\nsupplles and dual hard drlves that can be configured In RAID-1 redundancy.\nThe system chassis is a carrier-grade 2U rack mount appliance wlth\noptimized airflow and thermal management\n\nBivio 7000 Network\nProcessor Card\n\nBIVIO7000 Series NlMs are designed with software-programmable bypass\ncircuits so that i n the event of a power failure or other system fault, the\nbypass ports will fall \"open\", allowing network traffic to pass uninterrupted\nthrough the NIM The failopen occurs between paired ports on the same\nNIM This feature allows the network appliance to be placed directly in-line\nin the networktopology without adding additional switches or routers\nwhen used in a transparent mode deployment.\n\nScalable Processing & Performance\nThe BIVIO7500archltecture Includes the capability to stack multiple\nplatforms using unique scaling technology that dellvers unprecedented\napplication performance and throughput for multiple 10 Gbps linksall managed as a single logical system. Chassis may be stacked wlth\nadditional APCs to provlde additional application performance, NPCs\nfor greater system throughput on multi 1OG links, or a combination of\nboth NPCs and APCs. NPC scallng also provides greater I/O capacity t o\nthe system if required.\n\nHigh Availability (HA)\nThe B~vio7000 Ser~esNetwork Appliance Platforms provide numerous\nHA system features that eliminate any slngle points of failure to deliver\nnon-stop misslon-critical services. Standard system HA features include\ndual redundant hot-swap power supplles, dual redundant hard drlves\nwith RAID-l, internal redundancy of Appllcation Processors wlth fallureadapt~veload balancing, and software- and hardware-basedfallopen\n(bypass) network rnterfaces. Additional HA capabilities are also supported\nincluding external system redundancy configuratlons,and an independent management processor wlth an Isolated control network and\nmanagement port. The Bivio architecture ensures sufflclent resources\nfor each application even at full llne rate processing.\n\nBiviOSTM\nSoftware\nAt the foundation of the BIVIOplatform 1s a standard Llnux execution\nenvironment that allows any Linux-based networking application to run\non the appliance with little porting effort.The BIVIO software environment\nIS called BlviOS\" and includes a comprehensive set of networking and\nmanagement features in additlon to the Linux kernel and common APls.\nBy baslng the Bivio network appliance on a standard, pre-ported Lrnux\ndistr~butionwith full API compatibility, software developers can quickly\nand easily run appllcatlons wlthin hours of unpacking the device. BiviOS\"\nis transparent to the programmer but immediately allows applications to\ntake full advantage of the performance, flexibility, and scalability Inherent\nin the Blvio 7000 Series platforms.\n\nNetwork Connectivity with ProgrammableBypass\nNetwork Interface Modules (NIMs) simplify the connection of the Bivio\n7000 Serles Network Appliance Platforms to a variety of industry standard\nnetwork interfaces The platform includes two NIM slots that are populated with the appropriate type and number of interfaces required for\neach installation without impacting the appliance system archltecture.\nMany network topologies require fallsafe protection from devlces that\nare installed as \"in-line\" elements on the network. This requirement\nguarantees that an equipment failure will not cause a network outage\nor loss of connectivity.This requirement may be met by deploying\nsystems in redundant failover configuratlons or by providing hardware\nbypass circuits on the network interface ports.\n\nBiviOS\" also supports a rlch set of software infrastructure components\nthat allow developers to quickly realize advanced capabilities of the\nBivio network appliance.These components provide a varlety of critical\nservlces including robust traffic management and load distribution across\nthe multiple Application Processor CPUs. Bivio Appllcation Programming\nInterfaces (APls) enable further customization and optimizatron of the\nBivio architectureto the specific application requirements.\n\nTraffic Modes\nAll Bivio 7000 Serles platforms can be configured to support either of\ntwo traffic modes: transparent mode or mixed mode. Transparent mode\nsupports traditronal inline or \"sniff\" behavior, as all network interfaces are\nconfigured with no IP address and the platform appears invisible, or like\na wire, to the networkdevices on either side. Mixed mode allows configurations to be used where some interfaces are In transparent mode, and\nsome (or even all) interfaces are in gateway or \"routed\" mode.

Designed specifically to provide wire\nspeed deep packet processing,the Bivio 7000 Series architecture fuses Network\nProcessing components with Application ProcessingCPUs to deliver uncompromising performance and unmatched flexibility.The platform family includes\ntwo main product groups that provide performance optimized features to deliver\ntrue line rate packet processing from 4 Gbps to more than 10 Gbps throughput\nusing seamless scaling technology.\nThe Bivio 7000Series platforms are fully programmable systems that allow any\nLinux-based networking application to run on the appliance with little or no\nporting effort. By basing the platforms on a standard, pre-ported Linux distribution\nwith full API compatibility, software developers can quickly and easily run applications within hours of unpacking the device. A rich set of software infrastructure\ncomponents further allow developers to quickly realize advanced capabilities of the\nplatform including robust traffic management, load distribution across the multiple\nApplication Processor CPUs, high availability and system management integration.\nDeploying solutions on Bivio 7000 Series platforms allow customers t o achieve\ndisruptive improvements in deep packet inspection and processing performance\nsystems cost, reliability, and scalability for their open source, commercial and\ncustom developed solutions. Bivio platforms are ideal for a wide range of\napplications such as cybersecurity, content management, policy enforcement,\nand network intelligence.\n\n\fA significant shortcoming of traditional proxy-based URLfiltering systems\nis that only the traffic routed to the proxy servers can be filtered (ports 80,\n8080,443, etc.). The Bivio NCCS uses Bivio's advanced Flowlnspect DPI\nEngine to filter HTTP traffic regardless of the port used by the service.\nThe Bivio NCCS web content control technology is based on a stateof-the-art URL categorization and content rating engine, supporting\ncontrolled access to any combination of over 80 website content\ncategories, including many categories specific to sites optimized\nfor viewing on wireless/mobile devices. With over 350 million URLs\nclassified in over 20 languages, the Bivio NCCS provides coverage\nfor the smallest regional to largest global deployments. Network\nadministrators may also import custom whitelist and blacklist sites\nfor specific enforcement concerns for comprehensive content control\nwith fine-tuned precision.\nAdvanced features of NCCS include the ability to enforce policy based\non the specific destination IP address, as well as supporting HTTP\nkeyword matching and URI wildcards.\n\nTransparent DNS Overriding\nThe Bivio NCCS incorporates a DNS overriding technology that can\nbe used to block access to common tunneling/proxying techniques\nthat may be employed by illicit hackers to circumvent network policy.\nIn fact, the DNS overriding capability further permits transparent and\naccurate enforcement of site accessibility without modifying the general DNS server infrastructureconfiguration. This allows customers to\neasily conform with local government regulatory requirements while\nsubstituting an altered DNS response to the network user that does\nnot identify the enforcement policy.\n\nVolP Identification, Control and Blocking\nAnother characteristic of the Bivio NCCS traffic enforcement\nfunctionality is the ability to classify, identify and control VolP traffic\nflows, enabling administrators to apply flexible and granular policies\nin full compliance with their network control, cyber security and\nregulatory goals.The NCCS combines different key technologies\nto enforce VolP traffic policy:\nFlow marking based on the 5-tuple of IP addresses, protocol and\nport numbers, with flow-state information maintained in memory;\nHeuristic mapping to control/block identified traffic based on\nSuper-Node (SN) knowledge.\nAnalysis, identification, reporting and control of users VolP services\nprovides valuable user statistics and information that enable\ncompliance with internally developed or regulatory mandated policies.\nThis unique approach makes the Bivio NCCS the ideal solution to\ndetect, block and provide maximum accuracy in managing Skype\nand other P2P VolP traffic.\n\nMobile-Ready Content Control for Carriers\nToday's mobile user introduces new complexity for carriers who are\nenforcing web content policy. User IP addresses can change from device\nto device or location to location, making it difficult to identify and maintain user policy.The Bivio NCCS is mobile-ready, with built-in support for\nmobile broadband networks. Key highlights for NCCS mobile deployments include:\nIdentificationof actual user/lP source for WAP requests, coming frorri\nthe WAP Gateway\n\nTraffic Enforcementfor Today and the Future\n\nFiltering rules follow the user on different devices\n\nWith the rapid expansion of broadband applications, network\nproviders are acutely aware that a significant amount of their network's\nbandwidth is consumed by traffic such as P2P, VolP, YouTube, and\nmore. Besides consuming a huge amount of bandwidth,this traffic may\noften contain malicious or restricted content, such as security threats\nor confidential data. In some cases, administrators may find that some\nservices are overwhelming the network infrastructurea t particular\ntimes of the day and causing dissatisfaction among network users.\n\nSupports mobile data description languages\n\nThe Bivio NCCS, powered by Bivio's advanced Flowlnspect DPI Engine,\nprovides full visibility and control of all users accessing the network, the\ntypes of traffic they can transmit and services they can access. Network\nadministrators can use the NCCS to accurately identify and manage\ntraffic flows based on specific applications, protocols and users.\nAs networking is very dynamic, one of the major challenges of network\ntraffic enforcement is the ever-changing applicationand protocol\nsignatures that are used to identify an application within a specific\ntraffic flow. Bivio has overcome this challenge with a unique capability\nof the Bivio NCCS that addresses frequently changing protocol versions\nand enhancements. As new protocols and applications emerge, dynamic libraries on the NCCS are updated so that analysis and identification\ncontinues uninterrupted. Unclassified traffic flows are also managed to\neliminate potential network threats.\n\nBuilt-in load balancing features ensure scalability even in distributed\nmobile networks\n\nBivio's Network Content Control System - The Best\nSolution for Wireline and Mobile Network Awareness\nand Control\nThe Bivio NCCS delivers web content control and traffic enforcement\nfunctionality for customers to protect and optimize their fixed and mobile\nnetwork communications infrastructure. Completely self-contained and\ncapable of operating transparently inline, the NCCS can be deployed at\nany location,such as the data center, lnternet gateway, or point of presence (POP).\n\nThe BMo NCCS Is o corrierwade wtmd d g n d to creote, manage, cmtrol and\nenforceumgepdiciestbr~van'e&o~htemt~m'ces,\nprcsentond~tw,\non a or-wer\nh i s .

However, those who\noppose our way of life also use the\nsame mobile technology to stay\nhidden whilst working against our\nsociety. The challenge in homeland\nsecurity is to find the source of this\ncontinually evolving threat amongst\nordinary, innocent civilians.\nCambridge Consultants has created\na reference design which enables\ndevelopment of \"pocket-sized\"\nwireless equipment for use by\ngovernment and police. Possible\nuses in homeland security include\nthe following applications:\n\nIMSI catcher\nPortable base-station for secure\nuser group communications\nNetwork traffic monitor for legal\nintercept\n\nIntroducing Sidewinder\n\nCustomisation\n\nCambridge Consultants' Sidewinder\nhardware reference design provides\na complete and low-costmanufacturable base-station\nhardware design, suitable for smallcell 2G and 3G operation. Designed\nfor use as a small cellular basestation (femtocell), Sidewinder can\nalso be adapted to make similar\nproducts for use in surveillance.\n\nSidewinder provides base-station\ncapability in its standard form.\n\nRadio\nchannels\n\nb GSM 850,900,1800,1900\nb 3G band-l (2.1GHz)\n\nDimensions\n\n92mm X 80mm\n\nPower\n\n6W (maximum)\n\nTX Power\n\n+5dBm\n\nRX Sens.\n\nBetter -104dBm (for GSM)\n\nConnectors\n\nEthemet 100BT\nDebug - JTAG, UART\nSMA antenna connector\n\nE-BOM\n\nb Under $200 (estimated)\n\nAlternatively, Cambridge\nConsultants can provide hardware\ndesign customization services to\nadapt the design for alternative\nspecifications, such as 3G network\nmonitoring, multi-band support,\nincreased transmit power, receiver\ndiversity or multiple channel support\n(multi-transceiversupport).\nLicensees of the reference design\nreceive all design information, such\nthat they can also make their own\nmodifications to extend the capability\nof the hardware to meet their\nspecific needs.\n\n\fPowerful DSP\n\nFlexible radio subsystem\n\nOnboard Linux environment\n\nSidewinder is based upon\nPicochip's PC312 Femtocell\nBaseband SOC.The PicoArray DSP\nprocessor included in the baseband\ndevice provides industry leading\nDSP performance at low power\nconsumption.\n\nSidewinder makes use of the classleading Flexible radio device from\nLime Microsystems. This radio is\nintrinsically highly flexible, and yet\nprovides excellent performance. It is\nable to operate at any frequency\nbetween 375MHz and 4GHz, and\nsupports programmable channel\nbandwidths between 200kHz and\n28MHz.\n\nThe Picochip PC312 SoC includes a\nsophisticated ARM1 1 applications\nprocessor sub-system running at\n400MHz. This processor provides a\nLinux environment under which\nhigher stack layers and application\nsoftware can run.\n\n-- I\n\nado-\n\nThe PC312 DSP has optimized hard\nfunctions to support the WCDMA\nPHY and Lower-MAC reference\nsoftware available directly from\nPicochip.\nThe PC312 has sufficient soft\nprogrammable DSP resources to run\na sophisticated 2.75G PHY.\nCambridge Consultants' Centaur\nsoftware is the only GSM, GPRS\nand EDGE PHY reference available\nfor Picochip hardware.\n\nSidewinder baseband can be\nadapted to support software-switch\nfrom 2G-GSM to 3G-WCDMA\noperation.\n\nDuplex filtering, required to prevent\nthe transmitter from \"deafening\" the\nreceiver, is included. Sidewinder\nhas been designed to support a\nsingle set of band filters in any one\nbuild, but the desired band of\noperation can be selected at build\ntime through the use of appropriate\nfilter components. All necessary\nchannel filtering options required to\nmeet blocking requirements for both\nGSM and WCDMA operation are\nincluded within the base design and\ndo not need modification when\nselecting band or GSM or WCDMA\nstandard.\n\nOnboard frequency reference\n\nFlexible engagement\n\nSidewinder has an on-board\nfrequency reference.

This technology is\nset to revolutionisethe cellular\nindustry and can be applied to any\nhigh rate communications where\npower consumption is important.\n\n\fI\n\nI\n\nWireless from Cambridge Consultants\n\n-\n\nProject Example lridium\nsatellite broadband\n\n-\n\nProject Example WiMax\nreference design\n\n-\n\nProject Example Air-Traffic\nControl communications\nusing Software Defined Radio\nThe NEXCOM communications\nsystem is used for air to ground\ncommunications by aircraft across\nUSA and Europe.\n\nFor nearly a decade, lridium has\nused Cambridge Consultants as\nthe design team for its groundbased handsets, transceivers and\nmilitary equipment. The design\nobjective with \"OpenPorKIY was to\ncreate a broadband service that\ndelivered the capacity of 64x\nsimultaneous voice telephony calls.\n\npicoChip approached Cambridge\nConsultants for the design of a\nWiMAX physical layer reference\ndesign on their PC102 chip. At the\ntime that the project started,\npicoChip saw a business\nopportunity but realised that they\nwould have to move quickly. Our\ndesigners went from a specification\nto a fully working product within 12\nmonths, allowing picoChip to\nleapfrog ahead of their competitors\n\nlridium is the only truly global\ntelecommunications network,\nbased on an array of Low Earth\nOrbit satellites which give low delay\nand require no orientation of the\nhandset antenna.\nThe design solution used a flexible,\nadaptive set of 7 antennas in the\nground terminal equipment to track\nlow earth orbit satellites moving at\n8kmls whilst also adapting to the\nmovement of the platform which\nmay be mounted on an oceangoing vessel. The challenge in the\nreceiver design is to compensate\nfor the small received signal and\nthe Doppler shift caused by the\nvery fast movement of the\nsatellites.\nCambridge Consultants was\nresponsible for full system design\nand implementation, from concept\nto product launch.\n\nThis WiMAX implementation has\nbeen\nby CETECoM\nas the standard against which other\ndesigns are tested during the\napprovals process.\nWe have continued our relationship\nwith picochip, implementing many\ndifferent wireless communications\nstandards on their processing\nplatform, these include: GSM, 3G,\nHSPA+ and LTE.\n\nPark Air Electronics (now\nNorthrop Grumman) employed\nCambridge Consultants to design\nand implement an entirely new\nSoftware Defined Radio system for\nuse in Air Traffic Control (ATC).\nThe ultra-linear power amplifiers\nused Cartesian loop techniques\nwhich we were able patent.\n+-\n\nI\nAfter the development of a\nsuccessful technology\ndemonstrator, we went on to\ndevelop commercial products to\nmove the client into the new\nmarket. Cambridge Consultants\nprovided radio design, digital signal\nprocessing expertise and software\nsystem design and implementation\ninto the joint development\nprogrammes.

The dependence on GSM is growing\nrapidly, paralleled by unlawful communication\nand which is largely a safe media for criminals to\norganize and operate global terror networks. Law\nEnforcement Agencies across the world are\nscouting for solutions to intercept GSM\ncommunication for acquiring evidence to prevent\nsuch criminal behavior.\nSolutions deployed in the mobile operator's\nnetworks to intercept such communications are\ncostly, resource consuming and don't provide the\nflexibility of intelligence gathering operations.\nWhat is ideally required is a portable GSM\nLawful interception solution that provides the\nfollowing benefits to the LEA:\n- Stealth mode operation, transparent to target\nRapid Intelligence gathering in the field\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSmall portable footprint\nNo assistance or information required from\nthe Mobile Operator\n\nmTrail offers passive and active 'off the air' lawful\nlnterception of GSM 9001 180011900 Mhz phone\ncalls and data to meet law enforcement\nsurveillance and investigation requirements.\n\nDual Mode lnterception\nClearTrail offers Active and Passive off-the-air\ninterception systems. In the latter, it works in the\nstealth mode so that neither there is\ndependence on the network operator nor the\nuser(s) would come to know about the\ninterception.\nScalability\nThe system is able to support multiple bands\n(9001180011900 Mhz) by adding appropriate\nmodules.The system has the capability to scale\nfrom interception of 2 channels (carrier\nfrequencies) to 32 channels.\nMobile or Fix mode of Deployment\nmTrail offers two modes of deployment - mobile\nand fixed. In the mobile mode the system is able\nto fit into a rugged briefcase. In the fixed mode,\nthe system fits in a rack-mount industrial grade\nchassis.\nTarget Selection\nThe target(s) can be profiled using signal\nstrength, target numbers like IMSI,TIMSI, IMEl\nor MS1 SDN.\nCall Listening & Storing\nmTrail makes it possible to listen to the\nconversation on lawfully intercepted calls in\nnear-real time, as well as store all lawfully\nintercepted calls. In case of interception of\nmultiple calls one can select the call to listen to.\nPlease turn overleaf\n\n\fil\n\n0\n\nealylalu!\nelBu!s e q6noJyl pley ey1 U!paAoldap\nq u n uo!ldeaJalu! sld!llnw 40 6u!~o~uow\nalowaJ snoeuwlnw!s 6u!lea!lpy 'Jauuew\npeJflq!JlS!p U! 8~E?Jed0\n01elq€3Z!luO$Sn3 qu! 10301ad\npue SUS 'suo!amaAuoa el!qow yu!lu~op\n9 yu!ldn qloq Nen~elu!uea slauueya wldna\n0\ne~npWO~d\nJaAOPUey 1109 JaUe pey3iul eq Ue3 S11e3 UofleUJJqu!\n1030l0~d\np m SUS 9 ea!0/\\ S J O ~ U O ~ Jlesn\npua hq uogden~alu!paz!roqpeun Aue ~ u a w ~ d\n01 apow pepwsaJ U! etwedo 01alqez!wqsn3 -\n\n-\n\nW W !

Our clear edge lies in equipping our clients to mitigate threats\nemerging due to modern day communication, helping them pinpoint\nsuspected communications while countering organized crime outfits.\n\n\fv a l u e s\n\nClearTrail is proud to reflect its\nvalues in the company's strategies,\ndecisions, policies and actions.\nWe understand that a right blend of\n\"BUSINESS\" and \"VALUES\" is a must for an\norganization to achieve its underlined goals.\n\n\fClearTrail's values system is fundamental\nto its success. Our business is driven by\nthe following values:\nOriginality\nSince inception, ClearTrail has believed\nin originality. This has helped us in\ncontinuous innovation. We are more than\naware of how innovation matters not only\nto the world of Lawful Interception but\nalso to the success of our company.\nClearTrail's R & D distinctively\ndifferentiates it from run-of-the-mill\nsolutions, a value addition much admired\nby our clients.\nBelief in mutual benefit\nThe company has always shown\ndedication in creating a WIN-WIN\nsituation for its clients, a fact which gave\nus an early establishment.\nIntegrity\nProbably one of the most important\naspects of the arena which we operate in\nis integrity, which is deeply ingrained in\neach member of ClearTrail. Again, a fact\nthat has held us in good stead and\nproved a great contributor to the\nconfidence reposed in us by our clients.\n\n\ft e c h n o l o g y\n\nNext level of LI Solutions\n\nClearTrail provides solutions to\nchallenges of Law Enforcement\nAgencies, Intelligence Agencies\nand Communication Service\nProviders globally. ClearTrail\noffers a complete range of\ninnovative solutions for lawful\ninterception, monitoring and\nanalysis of voice and data\nnetworks.\nWe have defined new\nparadigms for large monitoring\nsystems by enriching range of\ntarget definitions to address\ncomplex & unforeseen\ninterception scenarios.\nClearTrail has established itself\namong thought leaders in the\ndomain contributing avantgarde solutions for the next\nlevel of Lawful Interception\nchallenges such as encryption.\n\n\fKnow the Unknown Communications\nTargets on modern IP networks can communicate over\na wide range of P2P protocols. It is a tedious process to\ndetect and decode such communication channels as\nhundreds and thousands of new services are being\nadded every day.\nClearTrail's next generation LI system identifies such\nchannels that enables LEASto zero-in on precise\nprotocols hence providing timely intelligence. Moreover,\nthe same monitoring approach proves equally relevant\nto both, LEA'Sas well as Intelligence Agencies, by\nhelping them intercept information that is not even\nexchanged among partners in crime.\nUnified Platform\nClearTrail unified monitoring platform supports both\nswitch as well as probe based interception over a\nvariety of voice and IP networks. It facilitates correlation\nand retroactive analysis of the intercepts captured\nacross diverse networks providing a complete view of\nthe suspect's communication.\nThe unified platform comes with futuristic database\ndesign that can handle Petabyte of information. It has\nbeen architected for mass monitoring of voice & data.\nThe entire functional elements of database can be\nscaled linearly and provide consistent and predictable\nperformance over time.\nStandards and Regulations\nOur systems meet LI regulatory requirements across\nthe globe. These are compliant with ETSl and CALEA\nregulations. Our products are efficient to cater to region\nspecific requirements too.\nStealth ~ e c h n o l o ~ ~\nClearTrail also provides exclusively designed stealth\ntechnology for active and passive field monitoring of\ncommunication networks.

The Repeater allows the use of small, low power\ntransmitters at the target, thereby giving extended battery life\nand extended operating range.\nThe Repeater works with all INCA transmitters and can work in\nthree different modes:\nRepeater mode\nReceiver mode\nTransmitter mode\n\nRepeaterThe Repeater receives a RF signal from an analogue\ntransmitter and retransmits it t o a receiver. It is possible t o\nselect between one of four channels pairs and one o f four\npower levels. The Repeater or target transmitter can be\nremote controlled from an X-IDER 4096 remote control and\nan INCA GM Keyfob\nReceiver Mode\nThe Repeater acts as a RF receiver. The received signal can\nbe recorded through the Line Out or listened t o by means of\nthe headphone connector. I n receiver mode, the transmitting\npart of the repeater is turned off, thereby saving power.\n\nTfanmmMMode\nThe Repeater is used as a high power analogue audio\ntransmitter.

I n addition, it features the\npossibility of recordingvideo and audio t o the SDHC card\ninserted into the device. It allows continuous recordings\ndespite of any radio path drops.\nFrom the remote control radio channel, the user can\nenable Idisable the transmitter and the recorder\nseparately, if recording, transmitting, or both are required.\nI n addition, the user has full remote control of the\nrecorder.The saved recordings can be viewed, played,\nstepped, or deleted remotely from a receiving end, or\nnew recordings can be made. All remote control features\nare available through the Repeater or by the PC software.\nThe device is compatible with SDHC cards from 4 to 32\nGB capacity with FAT32 file system only. It provides up\nto 35 hours of recordings in case of fast moving pictures,\nor up to 96 hours in case of static objects in front of the\ncamera. The user can access the RecordingTransmitter\nthrough the Controller, which has to be connected to the\nReceiver.\nThe Receiver must be equipped with the firmware version\n8.0 or higher. Older receivers can be upgraded by user.\n\nA real time clock is built into the RecordingTransmitter, so each\nrecordingcan be dated by a time stamp.\nMaximum file length of 30 minutes is ensured by the automatic\nsplitting function while recordingin order to avoid of very big\nfiles.\nCycle recording is available - when selected, the oldest files\non the card are automatically overwritten by new ones, if the\nSDHC card exceeds its maximum capacity.\nThe VLC Media Player is supported as best choice for later\nplaying of the card files by a PC. The Windows Media Player\ncan also be used, but the supported audio codec must be\ndownloaded in advance.\nSpecial VOX modes are available to trigger recordings.Although\nthe device does not offer recordings based on image motion\ndetection, recordings can be triggered by acoustic noise. The\nacoustic noise is captured by the microphone connected to the\ndevice and consequently starts the recording. Another option is\na door contact or PIR sensor fed to the audio input instead of a\nmicrophone. These trigger options extends the battery lifetime\nas the device consumes only 1 mA during waiting idle state in\nits most economical mode.\n\n\fOmega RecordingTransmitter\nTransmitter wtth built-tn recorder\nTechnical I n f m t b n\n\nsystem-\n\nReal Time Cbck\n\nRecodw me&\n\nm\n\nWonaltrmcbarundrrthepduewknns24hndnow&\n.-.\n\np\np\n\nRecordinncap~clty\n\n-\n\nWXewntrecordfng\n\n-\n\n\ng\n\nFor further lnforrnat~onplease contact:\nCobham Tactical Communications\nand Surveillance\nV k i n d b j e r g v e j 44, DK-8500 Grenaa, Denmark\nT +4587918100\nF: +45 87 91 81 81\nt?\n3 tcs.grenaa.sales@cobham.com\n\n#\n\n=\n\nUWK:ciirdfm4to32CB / ~ o s S D X C n a r s m m t e d _.\nFrom 35 to % hours on 32 G\nh eafdl flk a u t d t evefv 30 minutes\nVfdco l Audlo RK start& ty went inVOX-Ohl as VOX-OFF modtr\n\n\f",

The intuitive control 1 keypad of the receiver\nallow a new user t o monitor and record stereo audio in high\nquality within seconds. For the advanced user. the wide\nrange of options allow flexible and sophisticated system\nconfiguration.\n\nHigh audio quality\nThe Thor System is characterized by its outstanding high audio\nquality and a stable RF link which is achieved by use of a two\nantenna diversity reception technique combined with error\ncorrection algorithms. The audio quality is designed for high\nintelligibility of speech and thus the audio samplingfrequency\nand audio frequency response is 2.5 times higher than in\nmost digital voice tranmitters Irecorders. The built-in AGC\n(Automatic Gain Control) adapts the microphone amplification\nto the sound level, and thereby achieves a wide dynamic range\neven under the most extreme conditions.\n\nVarious communication links\nFor long distance monitoring, Thor prov~desvarious repeater\nlinks, such as RF, Ethernet and GSM. The repeater mode extends\nthe operating range andlor allows decreasedtransmitter power\nand an extension of the battery life.\n\n. . .? audio signal is digitally encrypted to prevent third-party\ninterception. Furthermore, the receiver, the transmitters and\nthe RF repeater incorporate an adjustable RF output power to\nhelp reduce the possibility of detection. For officer safety, the\nThor GM Key Fob remote control has a built-in panic button,\nwhich. when activated, will send a panic alert to all listening\nreceivers. For higher operational security and performance, the\nreceiver has a built-in remote control for controlling various\ntransmitter settings and functions.\n\nData collection and filing\nThe built-in solid state recorder allows for 28 hours of\nuncompressed, stereo audio recordings without a monitoring\nteam. and provides a backup document in case of transmission\nfailure. Each recording is time stamped and a digital watermark\nis made of all the audio data. This means that all recordings\nhave their own unique watermark and are tamper proof.\n\n\fThor multi location operational set-up\nThor multi location operational set-up\nTarget location\n\nThor body transmitter with SSR\n\nL\n11s 1230 volts\n\nThor receiverwith\nbuilt-in recorder\n\nThor System\nThe Thor System is a full-featured, portable digital audio listeningand recordingsolution for law\nenforcement agents, intelligence services and military forces.

We brought together a world class\nteam of RF specialists, product designers and software engineers to meet the challenge. The\nresult is a truly breakthrough product -the RFeye*.\nThe RFeyeei s unlike anything else on the market. Its performance approaches that of expensive\nhigh end spectrum monitoring systems at a fraction of the price. We offer RFeye\" systems and\nturnkey solutions in many different configurations, including standalone units and networks, as\nfixed, mobile or man-portable. We have created a number of powerful application software and\ndatabase packages for RFeye\" and our customers can develop their own applications using our\nopen API. We supply customers in both civilian and non-civilian sectors, including police and\nhomeland security services, defence forces, public event venues, spectrum regulators and\nnetwork operators.

Document Number CRFS-MD00013-BOO, June 2011\n\n\f1111111\n\nRFeye\"\n\nRFeye DF\n\nSingle- or multi-channel DF systems\nfor accurate target geo-location\nRFeye DF is a flexible, cost-effective platform for remote\nbroadband spectrum monitoring and geo-location of target\ntransmitters of all types. Systems can be configured using a\nsingle RFeye node or multi-channel with the addition of\nfurther nodes. They are fully modular and single-channel\nsystems can be upgraded to multi-channel for higher\nprobability of signal intercept.\nRFeye nodes are co-located with their antenna arrays and.\nfor multi-channel systems, with each other. This tight\ncoupling reduces cable runs and cable losses and\nsignificantly improves performance. Systems are compact\nand can be deployed in a vehicle roof box, on a mast or roof\ntop. Multiple RFeye DF systems can be installed on a site,\nperimeter or border to detect and geo-locate the sources of\nsuspicious signals.\nVarious DF techniques can be employed. The RFeye nodes\nmay be individually synchronised to a GPS timing reference\nor over a network connection using SyncLinc\" connector\nmodules. Once synchronised, all nodes sweep simultaneously\nfor precise geo-location based on time difference of arrival\n(TDOA) or relative power on arrival (POA) at each receiver\npoint, as well as sensing the angle of arrival (AOA) based on\nsignal amplitude. Each technique can be used individually or\nall three can be overlaid for high probability geo-location.\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nCRFS\n\nspectrum intelligence systems\n\nFeatures\nm+s\n\n#+-\n\nCost effective monitoring and geo-location from\n10 MHz to 6 GHz\nExtendableto 18 GHz with RFeye Block Down\nConverter\n\n~11111-\n\nMast mountable for border and site monitoring\n\n41111-\n\nLOWpower, ruggedised and transportable\nSingle or multi-channel monitoring using\nreal-time receivers\n\nrill; Simultaneous multi-channel AOA, TDOA and\nPOA overlay\n\n+- Fully synchronised sweeps using SyncLinc\" or GP5\nS+,\n\nRemote standalone operation or as part of a\nreal time network\n\n- ~ Easily\n~ l integrated\n~ ~ ~ into legacy and third party\n\nsystems using NCP\n-1111~~\n\nral~\n\nFully programmable sector and alarm\nwarning systems\nEthernet and cellular connectivity\n\n\f1111111\n\nRFeye'\n\nRFeye DF\nSINGLE-CHANNEL SYSTEM\n\nMULTI-CHANNEL SYSTEM\nStability sensor\n\nl 0 0 MHz to l GHz\ndirectional antenna\n\nUMTS\n\nCOMBINED SYSTEM\n\nBroadband bi-cones\n\n/ omnidirectional\n\nGPRSl3G\nantenna\nS\n' antenna\n\n'\n\n500 MHz to 6 GHz\ndirectional antenna\n\n2 GHz to 18 GHz\ndirectional antenna\n\nI\n\n\nMultiple mounting\npoints for alternative\nantennas\n\n1-\n\n.\n\n5 inch1125 mm aluminium\nalloy pneumatic mast\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATION\n\nMULTIPLE TARGET AOA PROCESSING\n\nFrequency Range\n\nE*.--.\n\nRFeye node\n\n10 MHz to 6 GHz\n\nRFeye Block Down Converter\n\n6 GHz to 18 GHz\n\nI\n\n\nl\n\nInternal Frequency Reference\nGPS 10 MHz reference\n\nTiming reference with GPS\n\nSweep and Triggering\nSweep time\n\n10 MHz - 6 GHz: less than 1OOmsY\n\nSweep mode\n\nFully programmable\n\nTrigger on event\n\nFully programmable\n\nL\n\ni?\n\nl\n\n:\n\ncost\n\nUnknown\n\nMobrles\n\n-\n\nBase stot~ons\n\n.-.\"\nS~rnulton,,,\n\n*Fast sweep mode\n\n.,.\n\n..,oted vectors\n\nSianal Analysis\nReal-timeanalysis bandwidth\n\n20 MHz maximum\n\nEquivalent resolution\nbandwidth\n\n20 kHz min.

Data may\nbe analysed at any desired geographic resolution, from world\nor national level down to individual measurement positions\nat street level. Data captured from either fixed or mobile\nmonitoring networks can be quickly and accurately displayed\nand analysed using a variety of tools. For example, the map\nview provides an overview of the data in a geographic area,\nwhilst the spectrum and spectrogram views give alternative\nviewpoints on the same data. Selecting data on any one of\nthe display windows automatically highlights the same data\nin the other windows.

In many instances, standard video\nsurveillance equipment is not robust enough to cope with\nthe most hostile of operating environments and often\nmodifications are costly and time consuming.\nIn response, Mirador has been developed to overcome\nthe most common of these problems - whilst at the same\ntime avoiding compromises in quality of video collected.\nDesigned t o incorporate best of breed video technology\nwith a unique continuous 360-degree view of the subject\narea, Mirador significantly enhances situational awareness\nwithout the need for unreliable ad-hoc adaptations.\n\nContinuous 360-degree rotating camera with a\n+/- 20-degree tilt and auto manual focusing function\nGas-sealed, waterproof (IP67 rated) camera chamber\n\n-\n\nDetachable base pods available that incorporate\nrecorder and trigger interface\nAvailable with either SONY FCB-EX985 or SONY\nFCB-EX1020 as standard camera modules (other\nSONY FCB modules available on request)\nIntegral optical and digital zoom options with image\nstabilisation, daylnight, blacklwhite and colour\nAuto sensing VISCA, PELCO D and LMW-OWL camera\ncontrol interface protocols enabled\n\nPracticaloperational benefits\nDue to its mechanical design, the Mirador has the capacity\nfor unlimited 360-degree rotation and offers both optical\nand digital zoom capability. Furthermore, the unit is fitted\nwith a lens that features a high quality zoom and image\nstabilisation function, allowing users t o focus on distant\nobjects with exceptional clarity. In addition, Mirador\nfeatures a proportional zoom facility that slows the speed\nof camera rotation during the zoom function, to thereby\nallow a steady, smooth pan and tilt at greater distant.

In comparison to other wireless\nvideo technologies, such as MPEG compression, TV1\nprovides a higher quality, lower latency and more resilient\napproach t o real-time video and audio transmission.\nMPEG and H.264 solutions rely on standard compression\ntechniques that can result in reduced frame rates, frame\nskipping and difference coding. In contrast, by combining\na proprietary codec with an adaptive and more efficient\napproach t o managing the underlying communications\nchannel, TV1 is able t o maintain a fixed frame rate and\ndeliver lower latency video over constrained bandwidths.\n\nKey features\nUltra lightweight, compact enclosure with no moving\nparts for reliable, resilient and silent operation\nSecure live video and audio (two way) transmission\nover very low bandwidth (supports 9Kbps to 1Mbps)\nRapidly deployable (in minutes) for operational\nsituations where installation time is critical\nConstructed to accommodate the high level of\nvibration associated with vehicle deployment\nFeatures two integrated GPRS/3G/HSDPA modules\n(with SIM carriers) for reliable networking\nChanges t o codec settings or software upgrades can\nbe delivered remotely over the air\n10/100 RJ45 Ethernet connector for ADSL and\nnetwork lines and satellite connectivity\n\nPractical operational benefits\nTV1 ensures a more efficient representation of detail at\nlower bandwidths, particularly where motion levels are\nhigh, as well as exceptionally low latency in the remote\ncontrol of cameras. Error resilience is also particularly\nhigh, since the TVl codec is more tolerant of packet loss.\nWith secure AES 256 encryption, an ultra compact form\nfactor, low power consumption (5.5 watts nominal to 1.5\nwatts in standby mode and 0.1 in sleep mode) and the\nflexibility to operate over GPRS, 3G and satellite networks,\nas well as tactical IP radios and the internet, TV1 can be\nrapidly deployed into a range of environments and\nsituations. The S400 includes two built-in GPRS/3G/HSDPA\nmodules for reliable networking and is network agnostic.\n\nOperational dornalns and Installed base\nTV1 codecs are deployed by organisations in the law\nenforcement, military and transportation domains, as well\nas by those responsible for securing public spaces.

    "text": "Unattended Ground Sensors\nZimiti C-IDS\n\nI\nDigital Barriers;\n\nCovert intrusion detection system\n\nThe Zimiti C-IDS is a ground sensor based covert surveillance system for\ndetecting human/vehicle intrusion in a secure area or along a border line.\nIts compact form factor, ease of deployment and self-healing low-power\nwireless networking make C-IDS ideal for use in harsh and remote locations.\nKeeping an ear to the ground in any conditions\nThe Zimiti C-IDS system is a next-generation unattended\nground sensor (UGS) system for covert monitoring of\nperimeters, borders and distributed high-value assets e.g.\npipeline infrastructure. The system consists of buried\nseismic sensors, connected wirelessly using RF. The nodes\ncreate a robust radio network, communicating with a\ngateway that uses SATCOM or GPRS t o provide remote\nmonitoring of the nodes from anywhere in the world.\nIts low-power wireless networking and resilient form\nfactor ensures rapid deployment and a long-service life,\nmaking it ideally suited for long-term deployment into\nremote areas and harsh environments. Nodes are quick to\ndeploy, easy to camouflage, and have long battery life,\nproviding the low probability of detection, continuity of\nservice and negligible in-field service required of a covert\nsolution. The units are tuned to detect people, digging\nand vehicle movements, with unit variants also available\nfor detecting animal and aircraft movement.\n\nKey features\nDiscreet form factor (only top is visible when buried),\nmaking it easy to camouflage to avoid detection\nSmall and lightweight system consisting of sensor\nnodes and gateway - easily carried by a single person\nRapidly deployable based on simple insertion of each\nnode into a small hole in the ground (tool supplied)\nSimple configuration - radio network configures itself\nand identifies most robust comms path t o gateway\nVery cost-effective system, opening up applications\nfor which military-style UGS systems are too costly\nHighly reliable alerting based on low false alarm rates\nthat are minimised by advanced detection algorithms\nRobust wireless networking, utilising frequency agility\nand a self-healing network from nodes to gateway\n\nOperational domains and installed base\n\nBoth the sensor and network technology contribute to the\noperational performance of C-IDS. Advanced detection\nalgorithms in the the sensor nodes minimise false alarms.\nFurther false alarm filtering is performed at the gateway\nby analysing responses from groups of sensors. The RF\nwireless network is self-forming, self-healing and very\npower efficient, providing reliable ongoing networking.\n\nThe C-IDS is specifically designed for organisations with a\nrequirement for a ruggedised IP67 UGS to withstand harsh\nenvironmental conditions. Its robust design is ideal for:\nCovert surveillance (seismic vibration sensors)\nRemote location with no supporting infrastructure\nTactical surveillance for forward operations\n\nWith its lightweight form factor (less than 0.5kg per node),\nminimal components (nodes and gateway units) and a\nself-forming network configuration, it is easy to deploy a\nmulti-node C-IDS solution. A small hole is made in the\nground, into which each node is inserted. Across nodes,\nthe network immediately identifies the most robust\ncommunications path to the gateway. The long battery life\n(up to 6 months) and physical and electronic robustness\nof the units means that ongoing maintenance is minimal.\n\nProduct codes\nZim-CIDS-N\n\nZ~mitiunattendedground sensor node\n\nZim-CIDS-GW Zimiti network gateway\n\nPre-productionversion -form factor\nis illustrative of producfion version\n\nO 2011 Digital Barriers plc.

    "text": "Network Instruments White Paper\n\nMonitoring and Managing\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\nAs with most new technologies, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\nbrings new challenges along with the beneﬁts. The main challenge is\nVoIP’s extreme sensitivity to delay and packet loss compared with\nother network applications such as web and e-mail services. A basic\nunderstanding of VoIP traﬃc and of the quality metrics provided by VoIP\nmonitoring tools will help you keep your VoIP network running smoothly.\n\nELEXO\n20 Rue de Billancourt\n92100 Boulogne-Billancourt\nTéléphone : 33 (0) 1 41 22 10 00\nTélécopie : 33 (0) 1 41 22 10 01\nCourriel : info@elexo.fr\nTVA : FR00722063534\n\n\fHow does VoIP work?\nVoIP phones use codecs to translate analog sound streams into digital packets for transmission. On the receiving end, the codec\ntranslates the packets back to analog. For two people to converse normally, all of this must happen in as close to real time as possible.\nFor call setup, most enterprise VoIP solutions include one or more call managers, which are servers that set up calls between VoIP\nphones, and can also provide gateway connections to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for calls outside the VoIP\nnetwork. Typically, the call initiator contacts the call manager, which then rings the phone being called. Once the receiving party\nanswers, the call manager provides a mechanism for the phones to negotiate codecs and connection parameters.\nThe connection itself is typically in the form of two full-duplex streams: a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream that carries\nthe encoded audio, and an RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) stream to provide communications control. Once the call\nis set up, the call manager is no longer involved until the teardown phase, when the IP phones inform the call manager the call\nhas been completed so the centralized call queue (a list of what phones are active) can be updated.\n\nWhat can go wrong with VoIP?\nDepending on what components of the network are compromised, users can experience audio quality problems with a call,\nor they might not be able to connect in the ﬁrst place if a call manager is aﬀected.\nAudio quality problems\nProblems with VoIP audio quality are almost always related to network delay, jitter, and packet loss, or some combination of the\nthree. It is common to see them together because they are both related to a general deterioration of network conditions.\nIn any VoIP deployment, some delay is unavoidable. Codecs take time to encode/decode the audio stream, and even the fastest\nnetwork medium is not instantaneous.\n\nIn addition to network delay, the VoIP equipment itself (IP phones, gateways, etc.) subtracts even more processing time from the\noverall delay budget. The delay budget for reasonable two-way conversations in real time is about 150 milliseconds (one way).\nWhen delay exceeds the budget, the callers can get confused about who should be speaking and who should be listening, and\nbegin to talk over and past one another.\n\n\n\fNetwork jitter and delay\nReal-time voice communications are sensitive to delay and variation in packet arrival times. Codecs require a steady, dependable\nstream of packets to provide reasonable playback quality. Packets arriving too early, too late, or out of sequence result in jerky,\njumbled playback. This phenomenon is called jitter.\nBecause no network can guarantee a perfectly steady stream of packets under real-world conditions, VoIP phones use jitter\nbuﬀers to smooth out the kinks. A jitter buﬀer is simply a First-In, First Out (FIFO) memory cache that collects the packets as\nthey arrive, forwarding them to the codec evenly spaced and in proper sequence for accurate playback.\n\nWhile a jitter buﬀer can successfully mask mild delay and jitter problems, severe jitter can overwhelm the jitter buﬀer, which\nresults in packet loss (see below). Increasing the size of the jitter buﬀer can help, but only to a point: A jitter buﬀer that increases\noverall round-trip delay to 300 ms will make normal conversation diﬃcult.\n\nPacket loss\nAs mentioned above, packet loss can be the result of the jitter buﬀer being overwhelmed. Other reasons include landline media\nfailure and poor wireless signal quality. The latter can be a big problem with VoFi (Voice over WiFi) service. Regardless of the\nsource, VoIP phones and gateways attempt to conceal this type of signal degradation by duplicating packets to ﬁll in the missing\ndata. As with jitter, these techniques can maintain voice quality only to a point.\nPacket loss on data networks has long been characterized as a “bursty” phenomenon, which is another way of saying “it never\nrains, it pours.” Networks tend to either sporadically drop single packets (these periods are called “gaps” in packet loss), or large\nnumbers of contiguous packets in a “burst.” Packet loss concealment techniques typically have no trouble handling packet loss\nduring gap periods; it is the sustained bursts you must watch out for.\nCall management problems\nIf the VoIP call manager (sometimes called the VoIP server) is overwhelmed with requests, or its connection to the network is\nimpaired, call setup delays can reach the point where users abandon calls before they are able to connect to the other party. If\nIP phones are misconﬁgured, or their IP connection to the server is impaired, calls remain open in the call queue long after the\nparties have disconnected.\n\nManaging VoIP quality\nYou can manage only what you can measure. Managing a VoIP deployment therefore requires some hard numbers beyond\nsubjective user assessments of quality (although these are obviously important as well). Beyond monitoring the network\nparameters discussed previously in this paper (“What can go wrong with VoIP?”), having an overall quality score such as a\nMean Opinion Score or R-factor score can also be a useful VoIP network health index.\nVoIP monitoring tools calculate the MOS and R-factor scores using a formula known as the E-model. Using the statistics it has\ncollected from the network, the analyzer calculates how much the various impairment factors (such as codec compression, jitter,\ndelay, and packet loss) would aﬀect the typical user’s perception of call quality.\n\n\fChoosing between VoIP-speciﬁc and all-purpose monitoring tools\nThere are a number of diﬀerent options on the market for managing VoIP quality, mainly falling into three categories:\n• Dedicated VoIP tools originally developed for the telcomm industry. These tools are great for testing IP phone and\ngateway designs, but not as good at solving deployment problems on a live network.\n• Network protocol analyzers that have added “VoIP Support” by buying technology developed for the telcomm industry\nand integrating it into their product line.\n• All-purpose network monitoring tools that approach VoIP quality management from an IT administrator’s point of view\nrather than from that of telcomm engineer.\nTo the IT administrator, managing VoIP quality is just another network task. This makes the third approach (the all purpose network\nmonitoring tool) often the most practical choice. But note that “VoIP support” means more than just decoding the packets of\nvarious VoIP protocols; it also means being able to track and display network delay, jitter, and packet loss, and to distill this\ninformation into overall quality scores, both per-call and in aggregate.\nAnd to be really useful to the enterprise, the tool should also track, store, and analyze long-term trends. This is so that you\ncan understand what is “normal” VoIP performance, and maintain a database of Call Detail Records (CDRs) from which you can\ngenerate reports for management or service providers. The VoIP monitoring tool should also be capable of automatically notifying\nyou when selected statistics indicate a developing problem. On all of these counts, Network Instruments® Observer® meets the\nrequirements.\n\nVoIP points of visibility\nIn switched environments, where to deploy an analyzer or probe for maximum visibility isn’t necessarily obvious. Complicating\nmatters for VoIP is the fact that each call includes both client-server communications (between IP phones and the call manager\nduring setup and tear-down), and peer-to-peer (the streams of voice data passed between the parties).\nFor example, consider the following VoIP network deployment:\n\nWhere to place probes on such a network depends on what you want or need to see. If you need access to all local conversations\non either coast, including both call setup and actual voice data, use a SPAN session on the access layer switch to mirror VoIP\ntraﬃc to the analyzer. Assigning all VoIP traﬃc to a dedicated VLAN makes this fairly straightforward.\n\n\n\fCapturing local IP phone traﬃc shows:\n• Any phone’s communications with its local call manager,\n• Both sides of the full-duplex connection between local phones talking to each other, and\n• Both sides of the full-duplex connection between phones located on opposite coasts.\n\nWhat you will not be able to see from this probe is any communications between the East Coast and the call manager located\non the West Coast.\nIf you are more interested in a coherent view of calls between the West Coast and East Coast, including all call manager\ncommunications, use a SPAN session to mirror both the uplink traﬃc between the core and MPLS mesh, and all traﬃc ﬂowing to\nand from the call manager. This will give you a coherent view of inter-oﬃce calls, along with all call manager communications,\nboth local and remote.\n\nWith a probe deployed in this manner, you will not be able to see the peer-to-peer voice traﬃc between local phones.\nFor complete coverage, connect probes to both the core and access layers at each site. Another alternative is to deploy probes\nat the core 24/7/365, monitoring the access layer with a portable analyzer or software probe only to troubleshoot local call\nproblems as needed.\n\nVoIP network analysis\nHow can VoIP analysis help manage quality? By closely monitoring the network conditions that aﬀect VoIP, you can begin\nto address developing infrastructure problems before they result in user complaints or downtime.\n\n\n\fTracking network performance\nConsider the East Coast/West Coast example described in the previous section. Ken, the administrator responsible for ensuring\nVoIP quality, has set up a Network Instruments 10/100/1000 Probe Appliance on the core switch to monitor all call manager\nactivity and any VoIP traﬃc traversing the link. He has conﬁgured Observer to send him an e-mail whenever any of the following\nconditions arise:\n• MOS falls to 3.5 or less\n• Jitter levels crossing the MPLS mesh exceed 20 ms\n• Delay levels crossing the MPLS mesh exceed 80 ms\nAny of these are indications that VoIP quality is\nthreatened. Given the topology involved, the most likely\nsource of problems is the MPLS mesh routers, which are\nunder the service provider’s control. By digging deeper\ninto the statistics the analyzer provides, you can determine\nwhy the MOS is falling, and what is causing jitter, delay, or\npacket loss.\nIf jitter is the problem, a good place to start is by\ncomparing jitter levels against bandwidth utilization\nto see if there is any correlation.\nThe analysis shown above (taken from Network Instruments’\nExpert Observer product) shows just such a correlation.\nDepending on the situation and IT budget, such an observation\ncould mean it is time to invest in more bandwidth, or time to put more controls on employee Internet\nusage for applications such streaming media and peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing unrelated to business.\nIf there isn’t an obvious correlation between jitter and bandwidth utilization, the depth of data provided by an all-purpose\nnetwork analysis and monitoring tool can help you dig deeper for the correct diagnosis. For example, if VoIP traﬃc across an\nMPLS mesh is subject to excessive jitter, it could be the result of “route ﬂapping” on the service provider’s routers. An analyzer\ncan conﬁrm this and provide documentation that this is the case. Armed with the hard data provided by analysis, you could then\ncontact the service provider so they can address the problem. If delay across the mesh exceeds the contractual obligations of the\nService Level Agreement (SLA), the provider may owe your organization some refunds for service failure, in addition to being\nresponsible for ﬁxing the problem.\n\nTroubleshooting connection problems\nWhen a user can’t get a dial tone, or there\nare excessive delays in ringing the other\nparty’s phone, examining a graphical display\nof how the call is progressing between the\nparties and the call manager can indicate\nwhat is going wrong.\nNetwork Instruments’ VoIP Expert displays\njust such a diagram. Simply right-click on\nany call or connection stream. Because\ndiﬀering protocols dictate diﬀering\nphone/call manager interactions, some\nknowledge of the protocol is necessary for\ndetailed troubleshooting. But even if you\nlack a detailed knowledge of the protocol,\nthe Connection Dynamics display highlights\nwhich party isn’t responding, or which\nparty is responding slowly.\n\nAn example of a Connection Dynamics display showing a VoIP call using the SCCP protocol. It is\neasy to see how such a diagram is essential to eﬃciently troubleshoot VoIP connection problems.\n\n\fSummary of VoIP statistics and quality metrics\nThe following table summarizes the statistics and quality measurements discussed in this paper, both deﬁning what is\nmeasured, and describing its relevance.\nVoIP metric\n\nWhat it measures\n\nHow to use the analysis\n\nJitter\n\nJitter measures the variability of delay in packet arrival\ntimes. In spite of the jitter buﬀers used to counteract\njitter, at excessive levels it can interfere with smooth\nplayback and cause packets to be dropped.\n\nBy using triggers to notify you when jitter levels are\nreaching levels that threaten voice quality, you can\nexamine your routers for problems or contact your\nservice provider and help them solve the problem.\n\nDelay\n\nThe amount of time it takes a packet to reach its\ndestination. Whenever packets travel a network,\nsome delay is inevitable. For real-time telephone\nconversations, there is a one-way “delay budget”\nof approximately 150 ms.\n\nAs with jitter, using automatic notiﬁcations to actively\nmanage levels of delay can prevent the problem from\nescalating to the point where users complain.\n\nPacket loss\n\nThe percentage of packets that did not reach their\ndestination.\n\nSporadic packet loss is usually insigniﬁcant. However,\nsustained bursts (see the next item) can aﬀect quality.\n\nBursts\n\nPeriods characterized by high rates of packet loss.\nThe burst percentage is the percentage of time that\nthe call experienced high-rate packet loss; the burst\ndensity is the actual percentage rate of packet loss\nduring bursts.\n\nVoIP phones have no trouble masking a lost packet\nhere and there by duplicating the previous packet or\nﬁlling longer silences with white noise. But users will\nnotice sustained bursts. If VoIP traﬃc has been assigned\nproper QoS and has enough bandwidth, the most likely\nculprit is media failure.\n\nGaps\n\nPeriods characterized by low rates of packet loss. The\ngap percentage is the percentage of time that the call\nexperienced low-rate packet loss; the gap density is the\nactual percentage rate of packet loss during the gaps.\n\nUsually not signiﬁcant, as packet loss concealment\ntechnologies are usually successful in masking the\neﬀects of low-level packet loss. Contrast with bursts,\ndescribed above.\n\nAverage call setup/teardown\n\nAn average of how long it is taking the call manager\nto open and close calls.\n\nA spike in these statistics can indicate a problem with\nthe call manager or its connectivity to the network.\n\nCodec\n\nThe compression/decompression method that was used for\nthe call.\n\nDiﬀerent codecs are capable of diﬀerent levels of quality\nsound reproduction. Higher compression comes at the\ncost of lower quality, but may be necessary given the\nbandwidth available to the call. If it seems as if the\ncodecs in use are using more compression than necessary\n(or not enough) given the amount of bandwidth available,\nperhaps the VoIP phones can be reconﬁgured to use a\ndiﬀerent codec.\n\nMean Opinion Score (MOS)\n\nStarting with a theoretical perfect score of 5 (excellent),\nimpairment factors such as codec, delay, jitter, and packet\nloss are used to calculate how a typical user would rate\nvoice quality.\n\nR-factor\n\nSimilar to MOS, this scale ranges from 1-100.\n\nThese are useful as quick overall indicators of VoIP\nhealth. If the average MOS falls below 3.5, or the average\nR-factor falls below 80, it’s likely that you have more\nthan a few dissatisﬁed users. If you see these statistics\ntrending downward, it’s time to examine more detailed\nanalysis to determine what is going wrong.\n\nConclusion\nManaging VoIP is similar to managing any other network application; VoIP diﬀers only in its level of sensitivity to network delay.\nBy keeping close tabs on delay, jitter, and packet loss, you can prevent network problems from becoming phone problems.\nHaving a network analyzer that includes sophisticated VoIP analysis in your toolbox will makes this essential task much more\nmanageable for the already overworked IT administrator.\n\n\n\f",

    "text": "nTAP™ Product Family\n\nProvides monitoring and security devices with complete visibility into full-duplex networks\nNetwork Instruments’ nTAPs let you monitor and analyze full-duplex links. nTAPs are critical components for network management because they provide\ncomplete and accurate access to live traffic streams. Without an nTAP, a monitoring device may be fed incomplete and misleading information: creating false\nalarms and missing problems that actually do exist.\nNetwork Instruments’ nTAPs ensure complete visibility into full-duplex network links without compromising network performance, filtering out physical\nlayer errors, or risking costly downtime. Regardless of link type, device type, or analysis tool, there is an nTAP solution that fits your needs and budget.\nnTAPs are ideal for organizations using analysis tools such as:\n• Network analyzers\n• Forensic appliances\n• Remote monitoring appliances\n• Intrusion detection systems (IDS)\n• Security monitoring devices\n\nAnalysis Device\nIntrusion Detection\nSystem\n\nRouter\nServer Farm\n\nAggregator nTAP\nServer\nDistribution\n\nCopper nTAP\n\nCore\n\nOptical nTAP\n\nForensic Device\n\nAnalysis Device\n\n\fAggregator Copper nTAPs\nAggregator nTAPs provide a copy of the data from full-duplex copper links integrated into a single stream to an analysis or security device with a\nstandard (single-receive) capture interface.\nAggregator nTAP\n\n• Contains a 256 or 512 MB buffer designed to cache network traffic spikes that exceed an\nanalyzer’s capture capacity\n• Auto-negotiates to support 10 Mb, 100 Mb, or 1000 Mb network traffic\n• Optionally transfers 10 Mb or 100 Mb input from the network to an analyzer connected\nto a gigabit link, eliminating the chance of dropped packets from buffer saturation\nAggregator Conversion nTAP\n\n• Contains a 256 or 512 MB buffer designed to cache network traffic spikes that exceed an\nanalyzer’s capture capacity\n• Streams full-duplex traffic on a single TAP into two different optical or copper singlereceive devices\n• SFP-based outputs supports the use of an SX, LX, or ZX device\n\nRedundant Power Supply\nA redundant power supply is available for all copper nTAPs. By adding a second power supply, an nTAP will continue to send data to the analysis device\nif the primary power supply fails. If both power sources fail, network traffic will continue to pass through the nTAP.\nSupports Redundant Failover Links\nAll copper nTAPs have the ability to support redundant failover links. If the link on one side of the nTAP goes down, the nTAP will automatically bring\ndown the other link, allowing the corresponding device to switch over to a redundant link.\n\nAnalysisDevices\nDevices\nAnalysis\n\nExample of an Aggregator nTAP deployment\n\nI\nopper\n0 Mb C\n\nce\nnterfa\n\n/100\n\n10/100\n\nt\n\nder tes\n\nLink un\n\nSwitch\nSwitch\nServer\nServer\n\n\fFull-Duplex Copper nTAPs\nFull-duplex copper nTAPs provide a complete copy of data from full-duplex copper links at line rate for monitoring or security devices.\n10/100 Full-Duplex Copper nTAP\n\n• Transfers a copy of 10 Mb or 100 Mb traffic from a full-duplex copper link to a copper\nmonitoring device\n• Connects to the full-duplex link under test and an analyzer equipped with a dual-receive\ncapture card\n\n10/100/1000 Full-Duplex Copper nTAP\n\n• Transfers a copy of gigabit traffic from a full-duplex copper link to a copper monitoring\ndevice\n• Auto-negotiates to also support 10 Mb and 100 Mb networks\n• Connects to the full-duplex link under test and an analyzer equipped with a dual-receive\ncapture card\n\n10/100/1000 Full-Duplex Copper to Optical Conversion nTAP\n\n• Supports the use of copper or optical monitoring devices\n• Connects to the full-duplex link under test, and a copper or optical analyzer equipped\nwith a dual-receive capture card\n• SFP-based outputs supports the use of an SX, LX, or ZX device\n\nRedundant Power Supply\nA redundant power supply is available for all copper nTAPs.

Multiple split ratios are available to meet the needs of any network.\nDesign\nOptical nTAPs are designed with LC connectors that are far more compact than the more common SC connectors. As a result, a single nTAP unit can\nsupport one, two, or three channels. Up to nine full-duplex links can be supported in a single 1U rack panel. nTAPs supporting different media types\ncan be conveniently mixed and matched within a rack panel.\nConnection\nAn optical nTAP connects to the full-duplex link(s) under test and an analyzer equipped with a dual-receive capture card.

There are two common ways for a monitoring device to access network traffic: using a\nswitch’s SPAN session (also known as port mirroring) or a network TAP (Test Access Port).\nSPAN Session\nA SPAN session functions best on lightly used, non-critical networks. In a SPAN session, the switch copies the TX (send) and RX (receive) data channels, reconstructing the\nintegrated data stream. It then routes the integrated signal through the send channel of the SPAN port to a monitoring device. Because both channels are integrated into a\nsingle send channel, the SPAN port can only support a maximum of 50 percent of link utilization. Networks running business-critical or bandwidth-intense applications, like\nVoIP, are not appropriate environments for a SPAN port.\nA SPAN session also presents the following risks:\n• A switch filters out physical layer errors, which can hamper some types of analysis\n• There is an extra burden on a switch’s CPU to copy all data passing through the ports, potentially affecting timestamping accuracy\n• A SPAN port hides jitter from the monitoring device, critical to VoIP and other applications that rely on very precise packet timing analysis\nsession\nSPANsession\nInInaaSPAN\n\nintegrating\nsignal,integrating\nfull-duplexsignal,\nthefull-duplex\ncopiesthe\nCPUcopies\nswitch’sCPU\ntheswitch’s\nthe\nport.\nSPANport.\ntheSPAN\nroutedtotothe\nsignal,routed\nTXsignal,\noneTX\nintoone\nTXinto\nRX&&TX\nRX\n\nA Full-Duplex nTAP provides pass-through signals\nfor network traffic, and separate copies of both\nTX and RX signals to a monitoring device.\n\nServer\n\nServer\nSwitch\n\nTraffic Potential (Mbps):\n1000 (TX)\n+1000 (RX)\n2000 (full-duplex)\n\nAnalysis Device\nMaximum Analysis\nTX Bandwidth:\n1000 Mbps\n\nAnalysis Device\n\nDual-receive analyzer\nreceives the full-duplex\ntraffic (2000 Mbps) with no\nerror filtering or packet loss.\n\nSwitch\n\nAggregator TAP\nAn aggregator TAP makes a good compromise between the SPAN and full-duplex TAP options for low to moderate utilization links. The aggregator TAP provides access to data\nstreams passing through a full-duplex network link, copying both sides of the link. Both sides of the link are then aggregated into a single stream. The integrated stream is\nthen sent out a simplex port to an analysis devices with a single-receive capture interface.\nIts advantage over a SPAN is that the aggregator TAP buffers the analyzer output, which makes it less likely than a SPAN to drop packets during short spikes of high usage.\nHowever, under sustained high utilization (over 50%), an aggregation TAP will drop packets. The aggregator TAP will also forward layer 1 and 2 errors to the analysis device,\nwhich are essential for certain types of analysis.\nAn aggregator TAP is ideally suited for:\n• A light to moderately used network that occasionally has utilization peaks above the capture capacity of the analyzer\n• Working with an analysis device with a standard (single-receive) capture interface, such as a laptop or standard system with an analysis device\nFull-Duplex TAP\nA TAP is a passive mechanism installed between “devices of interest” on the network. The TAP can be placed, for example, between a server and switch, or a router and\nfirewall. Full-duplex TAPs transmit both the send and receive data streams simultaneously on separate dedicated channels, ensuring that all full-duplex data (up to 2000\nMbps) arrives at the monitoring device in real time. For that reason, the monitoring device must be equipped with a dual-receive capture card capable of recombining the\ntwo data streams.\nFull-duplex TAPs are ideal for ensuring visibility of highly utilized full-duplex links because:\n• A full-duplex TAP never drops packets, regardless of speed or utilization\n• A full-duplex TAP does not filter out physical layer errors from the monitoring device\n• A full-duplex TAP is completely passive; it does not interfere with full-duplex networks\n\n\fnTAPs FAQs\n\nOptical nTAP Technical Specifications\n\nQ: Does an nTAP require power?\nA: The Optical nTAPs do not require power to operate. The\nfull-duplex and Aggregator copper nTAPs require power to\ncopy the data stream and send it to the monitoring device.\nHowever, the data stream continues to pass through the\nnTAP, even if power fails.\nQ: My copper analysis device has a single-receive port.\nWhich nTAP would be the best to use?\n\nDimensions\nDepth\n\n7.66 in / 19.46 cm\n\nWidth (faceplate)\n\n5.85 in / 14.86 cm\n\nWidth (box)\n\n4.55 in / 11.56 cm\n\nHeight (faceplate)\n\n1.10 in / 2.79 cm\n\nSupported Media\nFiber Type\n\nMultimode\n\nSingle-mode\n\nA: The copper Aggregator nTAP is specifically designed for\nthis purpose.\n\nConnector\n\nLC\n\nLC\n\nFiber Diameter(s)\n\n50 μm or 62.5 μm\n\n9 μm Fiber\n\nWavelengths Supported\n\n850 nm or 1300 nm\n\n1310 nm\n\nQ: Will nTAPs drop packets?\n\nMaximum Insertion Loss by Split Ratio (dB)\n\nA: It depends on the nTAP and the environment.\nFull-duplex nTAPs\nFull-duplex nTAPs will not drop packets. It is critical that\nthey be connected to a specialized, full-duplex analyzer\ncapable of receiving two separate streams of data and\nrecombining the streams for analysis.\nAggregator nTAPs\nIt is possible for Aggregator nTAPs to drop packets. When\nnetwork traffic coming into the Aggregator nTAP exceeds\nthe capture capacity of the analyzer, the TAP will cache the\ndata that the analyzer is unable to receive.\nQ: What split ratio do I need when deploying an\noptical nTAP?\nA: While we recommend that you always test the strength of\nyour optical signal with a meter, if all devices between the\nconnections are within 30 meters of the nTAP, a 50/50 split\nratio is ideal. For longer hauls, it may be necessary to choose\na split ratio that diverts more of the signal to the distant\ndevice.\nYou should first determine the signal strength capabilities\nand requirements of your monitoring equipment, as well\nas the send power and receive sensitivity for the devices\non either side of the link being monitored.\n\nMultimode 62.5 μm\n\nMultimode 50 μm\n\nSingle-mode 9 μm\n\n1300 nm\n\n850 nm\n\n1300 nm\n\n850 nm\n\n1310 nm\n\n50/50\n\n3.9/3.9\n\n4.7/4.7\n\n4.5/4.5\n\n5.5/5.5\n\n3.6/3.6\n\n60/40\n\n3.0/5.0\n\n3.8/5.7\n\n3.7/5.6\n\n4.7/6.6\n\n2.8/4.8\n\n70/30\n\n2.3/6.3\n\n3.0/7.0\n\n2.9/7.0\n\n3.9/8.0\n\n2.0/6.1\n\n80/20\n\n1.7/8.3\n\n2.4/9.0\n\n2.3/9.0\n\n3.2/10.0\n\n1.3/8.0\n\n90/10\n\n1.2/12\n\n1.9/12.5\n\n1.8/12.8\n\n2.7/13.5\n\n.8/12.0\n\nCopper Full-Duplex and Aggregator nTAP Technical Specifications\nDimensions\nDepth\n\n7.66 in / 19.46 cm\n\nWidth (faceplate)\n\n5.85 in / 14.86 cm\n\nWidth (box)\n\n4.55 in / 11.56 cm\n\nHeight (faceplate)\n\n1.10 in / 2.79 cm\n\nSupported Media\nCopper Interface\nLink A / Link B (link under test)\n\nRJ45 Ethernet\n\nCopper Analyzer Interface\n\nRJ45 Ethernet\n\nSFP Interface (conversion nTAPs only)\nSX (850 nm)\n\n1000BaseSX, LC connector\n\nLX (1310 nm)\n\n1000Base, LC connector\n\nRegulatory Compliance (All Copper and Aggregator nTAPs)\nEmissions\n\nFCC Part 15 Class B\n\nCE Mark\n\nEN61000-3-2, EN55024, EN55022A\n\nAbout Network Instruments\nNetwork Instruments provides in-depth network intelligence and continuous network availability through innovative analysis solutions.

    "text": "L’intégration des technologies\nNetFlow and sFlow® à la plateforme Observer permet de fournir une solution complète d’analyse permettant aussi bien\nle suivi des performance des application que la mesure en temps réel de la voix sur IP ou encore l’obtention de\nstatistiques sur les données NetFlow et sFlow.\nObserver reste la seule solution permettant aux professionnels de l’informatique d’avoir une visibilité complète de leur réseau et de\nvraies capacités de monitoring dans toute l’entreprise.\n\nNetFlow\nA propos de NetFlow\nNetFlow est un mécanisme de rapport de trafic, inspiré de Cisco, que les fabricants intègrent à leurs équipements (routeurs ou\ncommutateurs principalement). NetFlow permet le suivi des statistiques de « flow » (flux) où le flow est défini comme un flux de\ntrafic route entre 2 paires d’adresses sur un port donné. Ces données sont ensuite envoyées à un élément de collection tel une sonde\nexperte de Network Instruments.\nIntégration de NetFlow à Observer\nToutes nos sondes expertes peuvent être configurées pour agréger les flux des différents équipements NetFlow d’un site donné et\nenvoyer les informations à une console centrale Observer. Les données NetFlow suivantes peuvent alors être visualisée à la console :\n•\n\n•\n\nStatistiques en temps réel\no Stations les plus bavardes\no Matrice de paires\no Utilisation de la bande passante\no Analyse VLAN\no Suivi des applications\nTendances à long terme\n\nELEXO - 20 Rue de Billancourt - 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt\nTéléphone : 33 (0) 1 41 22 10 00 - Télécopie : 33 (0) 1 41 22 10 01 - Courriel : info@elexo.fr\n\n\fAvantages de cette intégration\nL’intégration de la technologie NetFlow à l’environnement Observer présente de nombreux avantages :\nObtenir de la visibilité sur le trafic routé pour chaque port peut être un investissement assez lourd s’il est réalisé uniquement grâce\naux sondes, en particulier pour les réseaux utilisant les principes de load-balancing et de redondance. NetFlow, utilisé avec\nObserver, vous permet d’associer les deux technologies afin de bénéficier d’une visibilité maximale, à la fois économique et\nadaptable.\nNetFlow est efficace comme première ligne de diagnostic car il permet de détecter les anomalies du réseau dès qu’elles se\nproduisent. Par exemple, si NetFlow détecte qu’un utilisateur utilise une quantité excessive de bande passante, vous pouvez alors\nutiliser l’analyse experte d’Observer pour définir son activité.\nLa consommation de bande passante et la sécurité seront optimisées grâce aux sondes Expertes qui vont consolider plusieurs flux\nNetflow provenant de multiples équipements et l’encrypter avant de l’envoyer à la console Observer.\nLa technologie NetFlow est couramment incluse dans l’infrastructure de l’entreprise, il n’y a donc pas d’investissement\nsupplémentaire nécessaire.\nLa performance des applications a un impact direct sur la productivité de l’entreprise. NetFlow permet d’identifier quelles\napplications sont actives sur le réseau et fournit des statistiques sur l’utilisation de ces applications. Observer permet ensuite de\nrentrer dans le détail et d’analyser la performance de l’application.\n« Suivre NetFlow en environnement Observer nous apporte de nombreux avantages. Les données NetFlow révèlent toute activité\nanormale sur le réseau, et Observer me permet de \"remonter\" jusqu’à l’anomalie détectée. Même si NetFlow affiche des données de\ndiagnostic, j’utilise Observer pour résoudre les problèmes au niveau applicatif. Résultat, Observer me permet de collecter, mais\négalement d’agir sur des données déjà en service dans notre réseau. »\nStephen Joseph, LEK Securities (cabinet financier new-yorkais)\n\nsFlow\nA propos de sFlow\nsFlow est un mécanisme standard de rapport du trafic similaire à NetFlow, intégré aux commutateurs par les fabricants. sFlow\npermet de surveiller le trafic prélevé sur le fond de panier de commutation des commutateurs, puis d’envoyer les données à\nn'importe quelle sonde Experte de Network Instruments. De la même manière qu’Observer intègre NetFlow, Observer fournit alors\ndes statistiques en temps réel et des rapports de tendances à long terme sur ces données.\nPour plus d’information sur sFlow, visitez sFlow.org.\nLa sonde experte collecte les informations NetFlow and sFlow, les traite et transfert les flux de données vers toute console Expert\nObserver ou Observer Suite situé sur le réseau.\n© 2008 Network Instruments, LLC.

détermination rapide du statut et de la santé\nAucun mécanisme de compréhension de la qualité globale des appels\nLes dépendances de VoIP ne sont pas correctement implémentées\nDes outils séparés

en\nstandard dans l’Observer Expert, la Suite, et toutes les sondes\n\nMOS, R-factor, QoS\n\n\fTableau résumé de la VoIP\nz\n\nAgrège les mesures pour les appels actifs, clos, totaux\n\n\fTableau du CDR de la VoIP\nz\n\nVues détaillées appel par appel (Call Detail Records)\n\n\fTermes de la VoIP\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\nGigue (jitter)\nR-Factor / MOS (Mean Opinion Score)\nQoS / TOS / Préséance (precedence)\nSalves (burstiness)\nBlanc (gap)\nDurée du blanc (gap duration)\nTechniques de compression (Codecs)\n\n\fGigue (jitter)\nz\n\nQu’est-ce que c’est ?\nz\n\nLa gigue est la variation dans le temps entre les paquets transmis et reçus.\nz Par exemple, si un flux de paquets quitte un matériel avec 30 ms d’espacement entre\npaquets et arrive avec 50 ms d’espacement entre paquets, la gigue est de 20 ms.\nz L’ajustement de la gigue des mémoires tampon peut entraîner l’accroissement de la\nlatence et par conséquent une coupure.\nz Le dépassement de la gigue de la mémoire tampon va introduire des pertes de paquets.\nz\n\nPourquoi la mesurer ?\nz\n\nLa compréhension de la gigue vous donne les éléments tangibles pour vous aider à\naméliorer la qualité des appels\n\n\fMesure de la gigue par l’Observer\nen agrégé…\n\net par appel…\n\n\fNote de qualité de l’appel\nz\n\nQu’est-ce que c’est ?\nz\n\nR-factor\nz\nz\nz\n\nz\n\nIdentifie la qualité de l’appel en utilisant une seule source de visibilité (appels réels en direct)\nBasé sur le E-Model\nÉchelle : 1-100, le maximum théorique étant 93.2 après la dégradation typique\n\nMOS\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\nDétermine le niveau de satisfaction de l’utilisateur pour un appel\nTient compte de différents facteurs (qualité du combiné, bruit ambiant, performance du réseau)\nÉchelle : 1-5, avec 4.0 et plus considéré comme satisfaisant, 4.5 et plus comme extrêmement\nsatisfaisant\nEn utilisant un appel simulé, le trafic peut être capturé à destination et comparé avec les données\noriginales envoyées pour identifier la dégradation.\n\n\fNote de qualité de l’appel\nz\n\nPourquoi mesurer la note de qualité de l’appel ?\nz\n\nz\n\nPour fournir des notes objectives et subjectives afin d’évaluer les conditions existantes et les\ncomparer avec celles historiques.\n\nComment l’Observer mesure-t-il la qualité de l ’appel ?\nz\n\nIl déduit un MOS simulé, car il ne génère pas d’appels simulés.\n\n\fNote de qualité de l’appel de l’Observer\nen agrégé…\n\npar appel…\n\net Expert…\n\n\fSalves (bursts) et densité de blancs\nz\n\nQu’est-ce que c’est ?\nUn burst (salve) est une période caractérisée par de forts taux de perte de paquets.\nz Burst Percentage est le % de temps d’apparition de salves.\nz Burst Density est le taux de paquets de données VoIP perdu pendant une période de\nburst.\nz\n\nz\n\nPourquoi les mesurer ?\nDe forts taux affectent la qualité de l’appel, spécialement quand ils sont associés à de\nlongues périodes (average Burst Duration).\nz Les raisons possibles de pertes de paquets incluent la congestion du réseau, la\ndéfaillance du media et la défaillance du lien.\nz\n\n\fDensité de blanc et durée\nz\n\nQu’est-ce que c’est ?\n\nLes bursts (salves) sont des périodes caractérisées par de forts taux de perte de paquets.\nLes blancs (gaps) sont les périodes entre les bursts.\nUn gap est une période caractérisée par de plus faibles niveaux de perte de paquets que\ncelui des périodes de burst qui les relient.\nz La Gap Density est le pourcentage de paquets perdus pendant les gaps.\nz L’ Average Gap Duration est mesuré en temps.\nz\nz\nz\n\nz\n\nPourquoi les mesurer ?\nz\nz\n\nLa connaissance du gap aide à la définition du burst.\nDans la plupart des cas, les paquets perdus durant les gaps sont rendus insignifiants par\nles techniques de dissimulation de perte de paquets intégrées dans l’infrastructure VoIP.\n\n\fSalve (burst) et densité de blanc de l’Observer\nen agrégé…\n\nEt par appel…\n\n\fQoS/préséance\nz\nz\nz\n\nSupport de multiple définitions de Qualité de service (QoS)\nAussi connu comme préséance\nAussi connu comme Type de Service (TOS)\n\nz\n\nQu’est ce que c’est?\nz\n\nz\n\nLa QoS est le positionnement du bit utilisé par les routeurs et commutateurs pour gérer\nla priorité des paquets dans les flux.\n\nPourquoi la mesurer ?\nz\n\nz\n\nLe positionnement incorrect de la QoS peut\namener à la contention de la VoIP et\nd’autres données sur un réseau.\nLa contention pourra amener des délais dans\nla délivrance des paquets et ainsi réduire la\nqualité de l’appel.\n\n\fObserver’s QoS/TOS/préséance\n/TOS/\nen agrégé…\n\npar appel…\n\net décodage…\n\n\fTechniques de compression\nz\n\nCodec est l’abréviation de Coder/Decoder\n\nz\n\nDifférentes techniques de compression (Codec)\nG.711: 64kbps (sans compression)\nz G.729: 8kbps\nz G.723: 6.3kbps, 5.3kbps\nz\n\nz\n\nDes compressions plus importantes réduisent le R-Factor et le MOS mais\nréduisent aussi la contention potentielle\n\n\fAffichage par l’Observer des Codec utilisés\nen agrégé…\n\npar appel…\nEt décodage…\n\n\fAnalyse multipoints\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\nSuit jusqu’à 10 sauts de\nconversations ou transactions\nPointe les goulets d'étranglement\nIsole les

WAN, les connexions\nEthernet, le trafic sans fil et les réseaux gigabit\n\n\fAnalyse multipoints automatisée\nz\n\nPermet d’identifier des problèmes de transaction comme la\nLatence et la connexion intermittente causée par la congestion du\nréseau, la fragmentation, la perte de paquets, etc..\n\nz\n\nL’Analyse Multipoints permet de déterminer d’où vient la\nlenteur:… est-ce en périphérie, en coeur, ou mon fournisseur de\nservices…?\n\nInterrompu par\nle fournisseur\nd’accès\nTemps\nPointage du\ndélai\n\n\fReconstruction de flux/Enregistrement de la voix\n\nz\n\nReconstruit le flux du

    "text": "\fMOBILE MPH-900@ALPR SYSTEM\nThe MPH-900@is the most accurate mobile ALPR system available. Digital cameras mounted\nto the exterior of the patrol car read up to 1,800 plates per minute from a stationary location or\nat highway speeds, cross referencing them against a hotlist housed on the in-car computer,\nalarming if there is a match. Data collected can be transferred to a storage server for future\nanalysis to aid investigations.\n\nFIXED FPH-900@ALPR SYSTEM\nA N D FCU-900@UTILITY BOX\nThe FPH-900@is a compact, digital system integrating all ALPR components inside a heavy-duty\nFCU-900@Utility Box. The system reads up to 1,800 license plates per minute day or night, in any\nweather capturing a color image of the car, GPS coordinates, and date and time stamps. When\nsuspect vehicles are identified, alarms are broadcast wirelessly to a command center, nearby\npatrol vehicles andtor officers' PDAs. The FCU-900@Utility Box houses the ruggedized PC which\nhosts communications, along with surge and power management devices, as well as a high\ntolerance heater and fan for self-regulating temperature.\n\nTHE ALL-IN-ONE FIXED ALPR SYSTEM\nELSAGS FPH-900@ALPRtechnology is now available as an All-In-One (AIO) system that\ncombines the power of our fixed digital cameras with a hyper ruggedized mini computer.\nThis compact, efficient system features low power consumption and can be set up anywhere,\neven deployed as a best of class covert solution. It features three Ethernet ports for additional\nFPH-900@cameras in order to support multi lane coverage and optional communication slots\nwhich support both cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing for seamless integration with\nELSAG Operation CenterTMsoftware.\n\nRADAR TRAILER\nGet the benefits of speed monitoring and ALPR in one mobile solution. The DRT-1000 transforms\na standard radar trailer into a powerful covert tool that identifies license plates connected to\nauto theft, child predators, warrants, scofflaws, uninsured vehicles, revoked driving privileges,\nparolees, etc. while serving as a deterrent to speeding. With the optional Emergency Power\nSource, 4000 watts of stored solar power are available for use during emergencies such as\nhurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and power blackouts.\n\n\f,\n\nB\n\n\\\n\nWith 70% of criminal activity in the U.S. involving a -..\nvehTile, and an\n-\n\n-\n\n.%X 5\n\n5-223\n\n- , C 'C.*\n--.l\nU\n-\n\nestimated 40 million license privileges rev0ked, suspended or denied,\nthe MPH-900@is critical to addressing\n.-\n\nReal-time Intervention\nAMBER Alerts\nAuto theft recovery\nHighway and traffic safety\nHomeland Security\nPerimeter security\nPlate manipulation\n\nIntelligence Gathering\nCoordination with other\nMPH-900a systems\n\"Late hit\" analysis\nLink analysis\n\nRevenue Collection\nGarage and lot access\nParking enforcement\nScofflaw violations\nTax collection\n\nSuspect surveillance\nTraffic pattern analysis\n\nProbable cause generation\nRental contract violations\nSchool bus safety\n\nMPH-900@A N D FPH-900@COVERT ALPR SOLUTIONS\nELSAG's ALPR systems easily adapt to covert applications by concealing system components in apparatus or compartments that\nfit in naturally with their surroundings. We continually work with partner agencies to develop creative covert solutions that address\ntheir specific needs, many of which are becoming best practices across the country for missions requiring undercover surveillance\nor inconspicuous \"private eyes\" along roadways and in other areas. All fixed and mobile covert products are crafted individually in\nour manufacturing facility in Greensboro, NC. Each one undergoes a battery of tests and must pass strict quality standards before\nbeing delivered and installed.\n\n\fTHE MPH-900@IN ACTION\n\nI\n\nDigital Automatic License Plate Recognition cameras are\nattached magnetically to the body of the patrol car.\nOfficers on roadways use cameras to scan plates of\npassing cars.\nCameras can read plates from fast-moving vehicles.\nLocations and times of captured plates are stored.\nAn infrared camera captures images of the plate.\n\nA computer reads the plate characters and compares\nthem with crime databases.\n\nDatabase\n\nYOI-NO10\n\nOfficers are alerted of a match.\n\nThe MPH-900@Performance\nCaptures up to 1,800 reads per minute, day or night\nProcesses parked and moving vehicles across 4 lanes of traffic\nCaptures plates at up to 150 mph (241 kph) closing speeds and passing speeds\nRecognizes plates from all 50 states, Canada, and Mexico\nFinds suspect vehicles within milliseconds of passing them\nAlerts officers immediately if a vehicle is suspect, indicating the nature of the offense\nCaptures criminal intelligence data including date and time stamps, GPS coordinates and\nphoto of the license plate\nEnhances effectiveness of Amber Alerts\nSecures sensitive areas with Geofencing\n\n\fELSAG OPERATIONS CENTERTM\nEXTERIYAL HONST\n\nConstant\n\n\nEOC\nYour agency's ALPR units collect vast amounts of data that help resolve issues in real time, as well as provide critical intelligence to\naid investigations. The ELSAG Operations CenterTMis the brain that collects, analyzes, and manages all of those intelligence assets.\nThe EOCTM runs automatically, without user invention, communicating with all MPH-900@vehicles,cameras, and tactical operations\ndesks in your domain, ensuring that each ALPR system is current with up-to-date information. The EOCTMsaves time, resources and\nkeeps your information safely stored.\n\nELSAG TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTERTM\nPatrol unit confirms suspect vehicle\n\n7\"\n\nAlarm automatically broadcasts\nwirelessly to Command Center and\nto TOC-outfitted field units\n\n-X-.irn\nVEHICLE\n\na\n\n'\n\n,\n\nDispatch confirms with TOC units\nthat alarm is valid and whether or\nnot he$ is needed\n\n'\"\n\ner.\nELSAG Tactical Operations CenterTMsoftware shortens response times and increases officer safety by broadcasting MPH-900@\nalarms to Dispatch and fellow officers automatically and simultaneously. This saves time during the critical period from when an\nMPH-900@officer receives an alarm to when backup units respond. TOC-outfitted vehicles do not have to have the MPH-900@\ninstalled in order to receive alarm information. Their TOC software works behind the scenes without officer involvement, coming to\nthe forefront of the in-car computer once an alarm is received. As Dispatch is verifying the validity of the alarm, TOC-outfitted\nvehicles are already on their way to help.\n\n\f.\n\n-\n\n-..\n\ng;*\n\n.\n\n$X>;-:\n\nINSTALLATION A N D SUPPORT\n.\n\n.\n\nThere are two options for installing the MPH-900B ALPR system on your vehicles.

But first, senior\nstakeholders need to be convinced that it is really worth the investment.\nBiometrics have been used to verify people's identity for thousands of years: beginning\nwith very primitive systems in ancient Egypt 'when records of distinguishing features and\nbodily measurements were used to make sure that people were who they claimed to be\".\nToday, 'biometric hand and iris scanners are being used regularly in the UK for workers\nto access high profile, sensitive, construction sites as part of developers' measures to\nenhance safety and security on sitef2.\nSome recent implementations have been problematic, to the extent that, today, the\nobjections to biometrics are more widely understood than the benefits. However,\ntechnological advances in the past decade mean that biometrics are now ripe for re\nevaluation by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) community.\nAlready there are working applications, such as the use of fingerprint readers to restrict\naccess to secure zones in some sophisticated data centres and the Citibank 'cardless\nbiometric payment erv vice'^. Trials have proved that it's possible to utilise facial\nrecognition technology, linked to boarding cards, to distinguish between domestic and\ninternational travellers at airports4.\nIf ClOs want to initiate, deliver and sustain biometrics-enabled identity management\nsystems, their main challenge lies in convincing stakeholders of the benefits.\n\n1 The measure of man, The Econornrst, 7 September 2011\n\n2 Bfometrfcscanners enhance OlympfcPark securfty as bfgbufldramps up, London 2012, 16 October 2009\n\n3 Cftfbanklaunches world's frrst cardless bfometrfcpayment servfce wfth the new clearplatfnum card,\nCfhbank. 8 November 2006\n4 Upgraded brometr~cpassenger scans at Heathrow, Afrport Internatfonal, 26 July 2011\n\nB ERNST&YOUNG\nQuality In Everything We Do\n\n\fWhy consider\nbiometrics now?\nIdentity fraud is widespread, and ranges\nfrom theft of credit card information to\nfalsification of identity documents to obtain\ncredit in someone else's name. Such fraud\nwill continue to grow if left unchecked. In\nthe UK alone, ClFAS (Credit Industry Fraud\nAvoidance System) and SOCA (Serious\nOrganised Crime Agency) have estimated\nthat identity fraud costs the UK economy\nmore than f l b n per annum. The true\nfigure may be much higher.\nThe UK abandoned the national identity\ncard programme, as well as a proposed\nsecond generation of biometric passports,\nin 2010, primarily on the grounds of cost\nand the lack of a clear benefits case. We\nbelieve that this was a missed opportunity\nfor the UK to improve its reputation for\nholding citizen data securely, and to enable\ngovernment services to be delivered more\neffectively and efficiently.\nA recent Ernst & Young publication5\nsaid that 'organisations that ignore\nthe importance of protecting personal\ninformation from outside - or inside [threats] will suffer more than financial\npenalties. They may also see their\nreputation damaged and their brand\nnegatively impacted'. This should be a\nwake-up call to buyers, sellers, consumers\nand delivery agents that it's time to\npromote the benefits of biometrics-enabled\nidentity management systems because\nbiometric recognition can provide a strong\nlink between an individual and a claimed\nidentity. The technology can help guard\nagainst attempts to establish fraudulent\nmultiple identities, and can prevent\nidentity fraud. By means of a search\nthrough stored references, individuals who\nappear to have previously enrolled using\na different identity can be highlighted for\nfurther investigation. This cannot be done\nwithout biometrics.\n\nPrivacy trends 2011, Ernst 8 Young\n\nBiometrics, when implemented correctly\nand appropriately, can enhance the\ncustomers' experience by making identity\nchecks faster, more convenient and more\nsecure. For example:\nF At entry points to some countries such\n\nas the UK, 'accredited c ~ s t o m e r s ' ~\ncan pass through automated gates\nrather than stand in a potentially\nlonger queue to have their identity\ndocuments inspected.\nF Belgium allows its citizens to establish\n\ntheir identity almost instantly when\nusing any of 100-plus government\nservices (including voting). There,\nand in other countries with national\nidentity schemes, there's no longer\nany need to carry paper documents\nto prove identity. Some of these\ncountries would like to allow business\nto use the same infrastructure to\nreduce fraud, with the potential upside of boosting their economies.\n\nBiometrics applications\nBiometrics-enabled identity management\nsystems can be used to deliver services\nat lower cost and reduce the risk to which\nboth public and private sector expose\nthemselves when interacting with other\nparties. Situations where biometrics\ncould help, or are already helping, include\nthe following.\nF Governments around the world face\n\nthe twin challenges of controlling net\nmigration and keeping undesirable\ncharacters out. In recent years, some\ngovernments have moved to integrate\ntheir border control and intelligence\nsystems, and, by adding biometrics,\ncreate a more effective and less costly\nsolution to controlling migration.\n\nis to say the document is genuine but\nfalse details have been added. For\nexample it was widely reported in the\nUK' and international8 press that the\nIsraeli spies who entered the United\nArab Emirates in 2009 to kill a member\nof Hamas used fraudulently-obtained\npassports. If all border controls had\nimplemented the latest International\nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\nguidance on machine-readable travel\ndocuments9, these spies would\nnot have gained legal entry to the\ncountry, because the images stored\non the passport chips would not have\nmatched the live images captured at\nborder control.\nF The banking industry and those\n\nit interacts with are particularly\nvulnerable to fraud. Having already\ntaken steps t o reduce card fraud in the\nlast decade, the banking industry is\nnow moving towards the use of voice\nrecognition systems to verify that\nthe customer speaking to the bank\nwhen not physically present is who\nthey say they are. Implementation\nof such technology will reduce\noperational cost and improve the\nindustry's reputation.\nF Retailers in the developed countries\nprefer to receive regular electronic\npayments for an ongoing service\nrather than collect cash. Their\nchallenge is to be sure that a consumer\nto whom they're granting credit\nis who they claim to be. Retailers\nin some countries use identity\ndocuments to reduce this risk, but a\nmore integrated system will no doubt\nimprove the experience that they offer\ntheir customers.\n\nF In recent years, there has been a\nsurge in the circulation of fraudulentlyobtained but genuine documents - that\n\nTypically, customers must pre-enrol to allow access to\nautomated gates.\n\n'Times onlfne,\n\n16 February 2010.\n\nWashfngton Post. 18 February 2010.\nICAO MRTD websfte.\n\nBiometrics: time to evangelise the benefits\n\n\fDealing with the objections\nto biometrics\nIt would be naive to assume that\nstakeholders will forget all their fears\nsurrounding biometrics. The kind of myths\nshown in the table below can be very\ncompelling, and without having given the\nmatter much thought people can easily\nbelieve them. For example, is it really true\nthat identical twins can fool an identity\nmanagement system? Easy to believe but in reality the vendors have resolved\nthis problem to the extent that the system\ncan spot the difference, or at least flag\nthat it cannot: in the latter case a highly\nexperienced human can then review the\nbiometric sample.\nCan criminals really chop your finger off\nand use it as a biometric sample? No. This\nis not the movies. 'Liveness' detection of\nthe biometric sample has been introduced\nto biometric systems in recent years to\ncombat this potential weakness.\n\nThe way forward\nIn 2010, Ernst & Young published an\narticle, Biometrics: primed for business\nuse1', in which we proposed three models\nto deliver biometrics-enabled identity\nmanagement systems. We believe that\nthese models are still valid, but within some\ncountries there is a specific lack of trust\nin government to hold citizens' sensitive\nbiometric data and to deliver complex\nprogrammes. We now believe that the\nnext growth area will be in industry-centric\nprogrammes and, where appropriate, in\norganisation-specific programmes.\n\nUltimately, we believe that all programmes\nneed to evangelise the benefits, obtain\nbuy-in, incentivise stakeholders and commit\nto landmark dates if they are to deliver a\nsuccessful identity management system.\nEvangelise the benefits - the benefits case\nneeds to be tangible and easily understood.\nIt is vitally important to engage customers\nand other stakeholders in order to build\nconfidence in the system, to obtain buy-in\nand to manage expectations (including\ndealing with those myths).\nObtain buy-in - biometrics-enabled\nidentity management systems are not\nwidely understood. Therefore, to obtain\nthe organisation's commitment, it's worth\nshowcasing the technology to decision\nmakers, and selecting a business owner\nas your programme sponsor. The major\nchallenge will be to balance the divergent\ngoals of the stakeholders.\nlncentivise stakeholders - the vendor\nand advisory market is maturing, but as\nwell as choosing the right partner for\nyour programme, consider incentivising\nthem to deliver a successful system\nwith you. After the system is launched,\nthese providers can help your business\nstakeholders to ensure that the system is\nnot fully under utilised.\nCommit t o landmark dates - implementing\nthis type of system is complex, particularly\nin the areas of requirements elaboration,\ntesting and change management, because\n\nyou're dealing with probabilities rather\nthan certainties. Nonetheless, to focus\nstakeholder minds, it's vital that the\nprogramme commits to critical milestone\ndates to keep the programme on track.\n\nConclusion\nThere is a bright future for biometricsenabled identity management systems.\nIdentity fraud is a growing problem; if left\nunchecked, it will spiral out of control.\nWe believe that the appropriate use of\nbiometrics can offer significant benefits\nto government, business and consumers.\nThe biggest challenge for ClOs needing to\nensure a successful biometrics programme\nis to convince the rest of the organisation\nof the benefits.\n\n-...\"a tmlt of a human being that L\ncan 6e used to identify \"them.. . . - * -\n\nI\n\n-\n\n=\n\n,\n\nBlornetrlcs: tlrne to evanqellse the benefits\n\n>\n\n\"U\n\n-*-m\n\na\"-*-*\n\n*\"\n\n'\n\nBiwmettFB \"curce:enfly.m use\njnclude4acial recognition,\n*\nfingerpririts, ~ignature~,;jcis, ,\nvdice recoghtim,+ein p & t e w * -+\n~~nition^'ail~d~pXrm~#eomeZiy.\nFurt\"hG\"rometrics are emergingap\nS+\n\naLya S'\n\nl\n\n-++\n\n_\n\nd\n\n---l\n\nFLY\n\nsis.\n\nl 1 Ernst & Young definition.\n\nhttp://perforrnance.ey.com/2010/07/16/b1ometr~cspnmed-for-busmess-use/\n\nd.\n\n*&\na\n\nIndustries such as banking or credit\nreference agencies are well placed to act\nas custodians of biographic and biometric\ndata.

The main challenge in this process is to collect and\ncorrelate target data from a broad spectrum of varied physical\ninterfaces and delivery formats, used in different CSP networks\n(PSTN, Mobile, Satellite, IP, NGN, etc.).\n\nAll ET1 acquisition units are flexible in network deployment and\ncan either be placed in the CSP network(s) or in the customer's\nown domain, depending on the requirements. That is, whether\nthe target data should be collected by passivelnon-intrusive\nmonitoring of selected communication line@),using a probe, or\nvia an active monitoring approach, in which existing network elements (routers, telephone switches, etc.) capture the relevant\ntarget data, and forward it to the acquisition units.\n\nCORRECT TARGET DATA\nThe EVIDENT solution verifies the delivery from various Communications Service Providers (CSP), to ensure that the correct\ndata is correlated to the correct warrant. Furthermore, EVIDENT\nensures that the delivery infrastructure is maintained, and that\nonly specific relevant target communication is intercepted, according to the interception warrant. The accuracy of the collected material is kept in an impeccable state, making sure that\nthe intercepted information can be used as evidence.\n\nFinding target data\n\nI\n\nWith ETl's Demon X-Stream acquisition units you can\nselect relevant traffic based on a warrant defined target\nselection criteria, e.g. e-mail addresses. Through an intuitive warrant management system, specific target selection criteria are applied to each acquisition unit, ensuring that only relevant target data is recorded. Real-time\ninterpretation of call related data ensures instant and\ncorrect correlation according to interception warrants.\n\nDEMON FOR CS NETWORKS\nThe Demon acquisition units intercept communication from a\nvariety of networks, and help to maintain the important in-depth\nknowledge of worldwide communication networks. The units\nare specifically designed for intercepting relevant communication, from a number of different circuit switched networks.\n\nReal-time acquisition\n\nI\n\nl\n\nThe X-Stream units are able to acquire online lnternet activity and VolP in real time, providing analysts with the ability to examine and process incoming transactions, as they\ntake place.

The X-Stream Database\nprovides a secure environment which accommodates privacy\nand compliance requirements as well as protecting your data\nagainst unauthorized access.\n\nFLEXIBLE AND SCALABLE\nThe X-Stream Database design is developed in cooperation with\nMicrosoft. The Database is Microsoft SQL server based and built\non tested Microsoft technology and operational database architecture.\nThe X-Stream database offers a range of scalability options and\ncan be customized according to your requirements for local/\ndistributed facilities, size, speed, and other operational requirements.\n\nX-Stream Database\nm Integrated storage for metadata and content\n\nm Scalable and flexible Mircosoft SQL database\ndesigned specifically for storing interceptions\nm Secure and customizable facility for retaining\nsensitive information\n\nm High performance maintained regardless of database size per design\n\nm Integrated ILM (Information Lifecyde Management) facilities for easy data management and\nsystem maintenance\n\nI\n\nHIGH AVAILABILITY AND SECURITY\n\nFUTURE-PROOF STORAGE\n\nThe X-Stream Database ensures operation continuity with the\nhighest level of system availability and security. Furthermore, it\nprotects your data against costly human errors and minimizes\ndisaster recovery time. With a fully scalable design, ET1 delivers\nan infrastructure that can grow with your activities and handle\nagency workloads including collation of information from multiple\ncommunication sources and multiple users accessing the database.\n\nRetaining interceptions require storing large amounts of relatively small files. Consequently, X-Stream database uses a design which enables the users to achieve top reading and write\nspeeds, even though their database scales into petabyte sizes.\nFile and database sizes will not immobilize users and their efforts\nto quickly access and share information.\n\ni\n\n\fI\n\nl\n\nstoring the intercepts\n\nINTEGRATED SOLUTION\n\nUNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES\n\nWhether you are challenged with intercepting communication\nfrom a single or multiple sources, the X-Stream Database offers\nan integrated storage solution for fixed, wireless, satellite, and IP\ncommunication.This flexibility enables users to add more data, if\nand when their activities expand. Future-proofing storage facilities is essential to successful operation in environments, where\nnetworks are updated on a regular basis, and new services are\nadded constantly.\n\nTo estimate storage requirements, the raw data input load provides a frame of reference and as evident from the matrix below,\nstorage facilities quickly grow into impressive sizes. Consequently, a careful assessment of data load and I/O performance should\nbe made when determining the size of the database.\nThe X-Stream Database stores metadata and content information in the same database architecture for speedy and optimized\noperation.\n\nm:\n\n\nInput load affect$ the database sue.\nlist\n=bows how muchlraw dita is output at cettain.\ntes, e.g. 25 MtiIkc i n p u t , g e ~ ~ t e263.'7'\ns : GB\ndby.whii\nequals\n94\nTB\npet\nyear.\nper\nET1 &ales 'storage:.mquirerieiits according b\n-specific requirbmentk bnd solutions are always:\ncu.stQ.m~ed..Consequently,,\nt h e list .is only a.. . . ... .. .. .. .. .\ngiiiddihe.\n. .\n.. .\n,\n\nI\n\n\f9\n\np,..\n\nScalable design\nMASTER AND NODES\n\nThe X-Stream Database design is based on:\nm A central master node, which holds all system configuration\nm Individual data nodes that contain the actual intercepted traffic (both HI-2 and HI-3)\n\nAll interceptions relating to a specific target criteria are saved\non the same data node. This design enables the database to\nmaintain a high overall performance, regardless of the amount of\ncollected data input, and the total size of the database. In order\nto uphold a strict separation between criminal cases, individual\ncriminal cases can be assigned to different data nodes.\n\nSCALING DATA NODES\nYou can seamlessly add capacity to your X-Stream storage system, by adding more data nodes and physical storage. Both types\nof extensions can be made on the fly, and without any downtime\nof the system. Consequently, you will experience no downtime\nwhen upgrading capacity to the database storage sub-system.\nThe amount of data nodes is fully scalable, i.e. one can apply up\nto 255 data nodes.\nRETAIN METADATA\nThe X-Stream Database also enables you to reduce storage requirements by having options for retaining metadata longer than\ncontent. Data management enables you to automate content deletion schedules whilst maintaining metadata.\n\nDATABASE BENEFITS\nTo support your need for securing storage of mission critical\ndata, the database design from ET1 offers you:\n\nm Optimized data security\nm Higher performance\nm Data integrity\nm Information Lifecycle Management\nm Transaction control and audit\nWith our database design you receive superior performance,\nsecurity, and user access to stored information, compared to a\nfile system.\n\nOperational features\nm STABILITY - There is no single point of failure in the\nstorage system.\n\nm SCALABlLlTY - It is possible to add data nodes and\nstorage to the solution, on-the-fly\nm LOAD B.AFNC1N.G -The solution has a built-in\nautomat~cd~str~butlon\nof traffic\nm HIGH AVAILABILITY - There is an option for having\na parallel redundant system located over two sites\nm AUTOMATIC RESTART- In case of power blackout,\nthe system restarts automatically\nm SECURITY - In case ofa power outage, there is no\ndata loss (buffering)\n\n\fDISASTER RECOVERY\nI\n\nPlanning for a worst case scenario, is natural in situations where\ndata is mission critical. Many surrounding elements can have a\nnegative impact on the system and cause system failure. The\nmost common are human errors, physical disasters, hardware\nfailure, corrupt or damaged media, failing scheduled, and unscheduled activities. Regardless of the reason, it is imperative\nthat system performance is restored and data loss is minimized.\nWith multiple features for swift disaster recovery, the X-Stream\nDatabase reduces the risk of losing critical information to a\nminimum.\n\nSECURITY THROUGH REDUNDANCY\nMaintaining an identical copy of the production database may be\nrequired for operational and security reasons. ET1 offers redundancy options which provides the assurance that mission critical\ninformation is always available.\n\nDATABASE BACKUP\nTo prevent data loss, the user should always have available data\nbackup. The X-Stream Database stores both data and metadata\nin the database. Maintaining a copy may seem insurmountable;\nhowever, by deploying various backup utilities the user is able\nto create copies while at the same time maintaining database\nperformance. This backup is the user's guarantee for maintaining\noperations at all times. Deploying individual or combinations of\nbackup techniques provides a superior platform for maintaining\na large database.\nThe X-Stream Database can use hardware backup, which optimizes the process of replicating the stored metadata and content.\n\nThe backup process is done using tested and proven methodologies for trusted 3rd party vendors. Backup options are non-disruptive and enables the user to save data and recover systems,\nif required.\n\n\fThe X-Stream Database plays a central role in the EVIDENT\nmonitoring facility ET1 has collected some of the most common\nquestions regarding the X-Stream database design.\n\nH WHAT IS STORED IN THE DATABASE?\nThe amount and type of data stored in the database is fully configurable. The database stores both decoded, undecoded and\nraw data. You can select all three or less based on your operational requirements.\n\nH CAN I DELETE CONTENT AND KEEP METADATA\nONLY?\nYes, in the storage configuration you can configure the database\nto keep metadata even though the content is deleted. If you follow a cleaning schedule you can configure the database to keep\nmetadata whenever content is deleted.\n\nH CAN MULTIPLE USERS ACCESS THE DATABASE?\nYes, ET1 scales the database according to the number of users\nwho requires access to the database. Multiple users can access\nthe same events. Whenever two or more users try to open an\nalready opened event, they will receive a notification in EVIDENT\nInvestigator.\n\nH HOW DO I CONTROL USER ACCESS TO THE\nDATABASE?\nAccess to metadata and content in the database is controlled\nfrom EVIDENT Director. The system administrator can control\nwho is permitted to see, analyse, and delete products.\n\nH CAN I HAVE A COMPLETELY REDUNDANT\nSYSTEM LOCATED AT ANOTHER FACILITY?\nYes, it is possible to install redundant databases by using replication and mirroring techniques.\n\nH WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MASTER NODE FAILS?\nIf the master database server fails, the database will then switch\nover to another node in the windows cluster meaning a small\ndrop in performance, until the server is up and running again.\nHowever, there will be no data loss because data is queued in\nthe Processing Modules or ET1 LEMF Gateway until the master\nnode or data node is operational again.\n\nH HOW FAST CAN I RESTORE A DATA NODE?\nDepending on your own resources to manage the database, the\nrestore time will vary. If you require ETl's assistance in restoring\nthe database, your Service Level Agreement should contain the\ndirecovery service which will specify how fast you can resume\nnormal operation. If you manage the database yourself, you\ncan restore the database through database backup or hardware\nbackup.\n\nH HOW DO I MANAGE THE DATABASE?\nThe database is centrally managed from EVIDENT Director application. Based on operational permissions, administrators can\naccess database configuration.\n\nH CAN I AUDIT THE DATABASE?\nYes, the X-Stream Database features comprehensive built-in\nfeatures for audit. Optionally, you can export audit information for\nuse in other applications.\n\n\fARCHIVING IN THE DATABASE\nArchiving helps you enforce organizational and legislative requirements for information retention and disposition. By capturing and preserving interceptions, one ensures complete, reliable\nintegrity for the life time of your archived information.\nET1 offers multiple options for data archiving. On-line database\narchiving with integrated ILM and standard archiving media.\nBy taking advantage of ILM and data partitioning, the X-Stream\nDatabase offers an efficient facility for data archiving. Using this\napproach gives the user a very fast and flexible solution, which\nis very cost efficient, compared to other available solutions. By\ndeploying a combination of high-speed disks for database facilities and low-speed disks for data archiving, the user maintains\nthe actionability on recent data while always having access to\narchived information.\n\nl\nI\n\n\nl\n\n\n'\n\nDatabase archiving automates the user's archiving processes,\nand all data marked for archiving will be stored in the database\nor can be exported to an external file sewer if required. Users\ndefine what data they want to archive, thus giving them full flexibility. Irrelevant content data will be deleted, however, all content\nmarked for archiving will be stored, thus ensuring data integrity\nand eliminating laborious archiving processes. With the ILM process, data will move to slower and slower media, as it grows older\nand less relevant. Ultimately. ILM can move it to an off-line media\nor delete it, when archiving requirements have been fulfilled.\n\nREUSING EXISTING ARCHIVING SOLUTION\nIf you currently use an archiving solution based on, e.g. harddisk, DVD, Blu-ray, etc. and wishes to continue on that platform,\nthe X-Stream Database supports multiple approaches. Reusing\nexisting archiving methodologies enables the user to maintain a\n\nmodus operandi. However; careful assessment of archiving requirements should be made whenever adding new intercepting\ncapabilities to the user's monitoring facility.\n\nMIGRATING DATA OR PARALLEL OPERATION?\nReplacing a large archiving solution can be costly and difficult.\nConsequently, it may not be ideal to change platforms over night.\nX-Stream Database offers multiple options for changing archiving platforms which support customer requirements. One option\nincludes running parallel archiving until the old system and stored\ndata is obsolete. Secondly, existing solutions can be fully migrated to the new platform. Migration is not carried out until the user's\noperational and security requirements have been well tested, assuring that no data is lost and performance is maintained.\n\n\fLearn more about EVIDENT:\n\n)\n\nAcquisition\n\nm\n\nAdministratio~\nPresentation\n\nGateway\n\nl.Acquisition\n\n2.Gateway\n\n3.Processing\n\nUnit acts as the point-\n\nUnit reconstructs in-\n\n4.

This kind of notification\nis a way of warning the analyst when certain criteria are met, i.e.\na notification is sent when specific target behaviours take place.\nThis can be exemplified by the following scenarios:\nm Calling a certain number\n\n-\n\nr\n\n1'\n\nSAVE TIME USE THUMBNAILS\n\nm Receiving a call from a certain number\n\nLooking through web pages or faxes one by one can be\nvery time consuming. To make this work process more\nefficient and user friendly, EVIDENT lnvestigator offers a\nthumbnail listing of events to quickly screen and identify\nimportant communication. This feature enables users to\nscreen multiple web pages or faxes at a time and with\nkeyboard shortcuts process all simultaneously, or individually.\n\nm Sending or receiving an e-mail\n\nl\n\nm Etc.\n\nNotificationscan be forwarded by pop-ups, SMS, or e-mail, and\ncan also be used to forward target calls to police officers in the\nfield (using Auto-dialler). This feature helps the analyst to focus\non vital information and disregard information that is irrelevant.\n\nThe screening process can also be automated with the Autowalker feature, which displays and flips through the intercepted\npages at a user-defined pace. The purpose is to swiftly work\nthrough large amounts of events and quickly decide whether to\nset event states. The screener follows the automated viewing\nand can stop the process at any time.\n\nTARGET PROFILING\nEVIDENT lnvestigator may also feature person profiling if\npermitted by national law. Persons or associates to a target can\nbe created, including names, addresses, and other identifying\ninformation.

This software offers a graphical visualization of mobile\nnetwork cell locations in which target mobile phones communicate. ET1 Target Locator enables the investigator to:\nm Locate a target's mobile phone from intercepts\nm Follow a target's movements\nm Document that a mobile phone has been in a\nspecific area at a given time\nm ldentify a target's travel patterns\nm Identify routes that are irregular to a target and\nhereby relate himlher to a given incident\nGeographical tracking and approximate localization of a\ntarget is a particularly useful option in situations where\nLaw Enforcement Agency (LEA) officers or other kinds of\nagents need to link a target to a specific area at a given\ntime. The opposite scenario is also possible: If one for\ninstance needs to rule out the possibility that a target's\nmobile phone is at a given location (e.g. hislher home) at\na given time.\n\nET! Target Locator 11\nTarget Locator 11 is an add-on module for EVIDENT\nInvestigator, the operator software program in EVIDENT X-Stream systems for Lawful Interception. The\nsystem offers:\nm Instant processing of cell location data and fast\nmapping of target movement between cells\nm Historical location analysis\nm Generation of reports for use in court, e.g. Court\nEvidence Disclosure\nm Various map types and formats\nm Zooming and panning facilities\n\nAvailable location data\nIn a GSM cellular network location data is sent via\nHI-2 from the Network Operator, the Access Provider, and the Communication Service Provider, to the\nLEA. The incoming data is subsequently processed\nin EVIDENT Interpreter.\nOur solutions collect data via ABlS or the CSP collects the\ndata for us. The acquired data is consequently forwarded\nto the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility.\n\n\farget\n\nS\nSatellite, topographical,\nand hybrid views\n\nA\nFollow multiple 1\ntargets\n\n-/\n\nFOLLOW TARGET MOVEMENTS\nET1 Target Locator lets the investigator see multiple\nevents on the map. This enables himlher to trace one or\nmultiple targets over a period of time and possibly tie them\nto a crime scene. Each event is numbered and displayed\nin a chronological order, providing a swift and easy way to\nidentify how events unfold over time.\n\nSTRUCTURED OVERVIEW\nET1 Target Locator II organizes events in a structured\nmanner, to enable fast and smooth navigation. Even if\nhundreds or even thousands of events are located within\nthe same location, multiple markers with related text on\nthe same location are presented so the investigator gets\nan easy overview. The investigator can thus select and\nview each of the markers. Based on the user's\npermissions, helshe is able to add and update\none or more marker in a layer, without updating all markers.\n\nINFO LAYERS AND AREAS OF INTEREST\n\nl\n\nIn addition to the information available in the\nmap itself, it is possible to enable and disable\nlayers on the map. The layers can relate to commercially available information, such as the location of bus\nstops, train stations, ATM machines, airports, specific\ncase information, etc. Various layers can be added by ET1\ncustomers depending on the information available for that\nspecific country, area, or case.\n\ntnfo layers\nprovide an overview\n\n\fINVESTIGATOR ADD-ON: RELATIONS CHART\nIn order to structure the communication that takes place\nin large social networks, EVIDENT Investigator has\nanother add-on in its suite of analysis tools: ET1 Relations\nChart. The relations chart software applies metadata and\nstructures the data in a simple, yet comprehensive way, to\nextract the maximum amount of intelligence.\n\nWHO, WHEN, HOW, AND WHERE...\n\nWith access to -information concerning the people the\ntargets communicate with, when they communicate, and\nhow they communicate (i.e. by which medium, frequency,\netc.), complex patterns are revealed. An overview of these\npatterns enables the investigator to direct attention towards\nspecific individuals and their location and role in larger\nsocial networks. Furthermore, it facilitates identification of\nnew targets in these networks.\n\nANALYSE COMMUNICATION\nET1 Relations Chart provides an overview of communication\nbehaviour related to telephony, e-mail, VolP, SMS, MMS,\nand fax. The software gives the investigator access to\nthe targets' communication patterns and their network.\nFurthermore, it enables the himlher to build a profile on\ntargets that are relevant to the investigation.\n\nTARGET DEVELOPMENT\nThe ET1 Relations Chart solution facilitates target\ndevelopment by structuring large amounts of metadata.\nAfter the structuring, the metadata is analyzed and one or\nmore targets can be found and displayed. Having found\nan interesting connection, the investigator can focus on\ncontent and content analysis of hislher communication.\n\nET1 Relations Chart\nETI ~\n~\nchart is la simple,~ yet comprehensive\n~\ni\nanalysis tool, which offers relational overviews of one or\nmultiple targets' communication patterns.\n\nVISUALIZE\nOne of the main advantages of ET1 Relations Chart,\nis the software's abilitv to disclose hiah intelliaence\nvalue from the intercepted metadata. hi system i f f e r s\nvisualization of large data sets and enables quick access\nand comprehension of complex scenarios. In brief, the\nsolution helps the investigator identify how seemingly\nunrelated data and persons relate to each other.\n\nCHOOSE VIEW\nET1 Relations Chart has two relations views:\nCommunications identifier (ID) view - The\ncommunications ID (e.g. e-mail address,\ntelephone number, etc.) is used as identifier\nPersons view - The person's identity is used as a\nunifying feature forvarious forms of communication\n(e.g. e-mail address and telephone number)\n\nThe latter view facilitates analysis, as all communication\nrelated to one person is connected to the communicator.\nExamples of the views are shown on the opposite page.\n\nCUSTOMIZE LAYOUT\nThe relations charts have two views: The Symmetric Layout\n(as shown on the opposite page) and the Hierarchical\nLayout. The former gives a centric view of the links,\nwhereas the latter, arranges entries in horizontal layers.\n\n~\n\n\fCommunicarions\nPERSON-RELATED DATA\nWith large amounts of metadata, post-processing may require\nthat the majority of the individuals in the network are disregarded\nand focus is on one or a few individuals, e.g. the person who\nconnects two major networks. This is easily done by double\nclicking on the communication lines between these individuals.\nFor each network member, callers, and calling parties, profiles\ncan be created, based on the information that is accumulated\nover time. This information includes:\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\n\nI\n\nName\nNationality\nMeans of communication (telephone, e-mail, etc.)\nNotes\nCharacteristics (IMSI, telephone number, etc.)\nEtc.\n\nPictures, video clips from surveillance recordings, etc. can be\nattached to the profile, to constantly elaborate on its content.\nThis will give the analyst a detailed understandingof the target's\nbehaviour and networks.\n\nSEE THE INTERCEPTED DATA\nWith ET1 Relations Chart the analyst can start with a complex\nsocial network and isolate vital communication based on various\ntargets' position in the network. The software lets the user double\nclick on the links between people or communications IDs on the\nrelations chart and get direct access to the data that has been\nintercepted(i.e. e-mail, VolP, SMS, MMS, and fax). As such, ET1\nRelations Chart provides a framework that facilitates complete\nrelations analysis of communication.\n\nlayout\n\n\fLearn more about EVIDENT:\n\n7 z\nGateway\n\nL\n\nProcessing\n\nAdministratio~\nPresentation\n\nStora:\n\n\nL\n\n4.

Consequently, their criminal activity can be revealed and\nstopped by intercepting and correlating their communication.\n\nThe investment and choice of a high quality interception system,\nto obtain, correlate and analyze communication, is the key to\nyour success, in revealing criminal behavior and solving crime.\n\nMaking the right choice\n\n,-\n\nET1 is the world's leading supplier of state-of-the-art monitoring solutions. Our EVIDENT solution is used for warrant\nbased interception by many Law Enforcement Agencies\n(LEAs) and intelligence agencies all over the world.\n\nEVIDENT is an end-to-end interception solution used to\ncollect, decode, correlate, and analyze specific target\ncommunication from a broad spectrum of networks, ranging from traditional telephony, through broadband IP, and\nwireless mobile networks, to satellites. The purpose of the\nsolution is to reveal criminal behavior of targets and provide\nevidence for legal proceedings, when this is applicable by\nnational law.\n\nE T S l\n:ompliant\n\n\fIt is EVIDENT\n\nFINDING TARGET DATA\nWith the growing IP user bandwidth and Next Generation Networks (NGN), it is challenging to identify network interception\npoints, to ensure coverage of all target communication. ET1 can\noffer our expertise in analysing your network, and help you cooperate with your CommunicationService Providers (CSPs), to find\nthe best interception points for your system in circuit switched,\npacket switched, mobile, and satellite networks.\n\nIDENTIFYING TARGET COMMUNICATION\n\nL\n\nIn complex lntemet communication, a target cannot be identified by a mere telephone number. In the EVIDENT solution, target identity is specified by applying target selection criteria, e.g.\ntelephone number, 1P address, e-mail, webmail address, chat\nnickname, VolP Subscriber ID, combinations, etc. Keywords in\ncommunication can also be used as selection criteria, if permitted by national law.\n\n-\n\nFULL DECODING PURE QUALITY\nTo identify communication 100% correctly, the decoding mechanism in the EVIDENT solution is based on a full protocol decoding concept, in which all application protocols are interpreted.\nAs opposed to other mechanisms that might lack accuracy and\ncould miss data, or even intercept the wrong information, full decoding ensures accuracy and recording of relevant and specific\ntarget data.\n\nr by EVIDENT ,\nCorrect interception\n+ Full decoding\n+ Specific selection\n\n= Exact target data is collected\n\nWhy choose ETI?\nET1has more than 25 years of experience in developing and\nproducing monitoring solutions and 15 years of experience\nwithin the realm of IP monitoring solutions. Our impressive\nglobal track record makes us the natural choice when customers seek advice concerning monitoring technology. Our\nforte is our state-of-the-art monitoring solutions. This is why\nour customers continue to rely on ET1 for the mission critical task of monitoring.\n\n\fSECURITY\n\nEND-TO-END SOLUTION\n\nET1 understands our customers' need for security and discretion, when working with interception. EVIDENT is your\nassurance that your agency's information is collected strictly according to interception warrants. EVIDENT can adapt\nto various national standards for issuing warrants, and\nmaintain adherence to legislation for secure handling of intercepted data. You can trust our solution to be handling\nthe collected data carefully and making sure that it is not\nexposed to the target or the CSPs. The intercepted data\nis only made accessible to investigators who are explicitly\ngranted permissions to the actual interception.\n\nEVlDENTisafullyscalable~monikhgsokrtioninwhiiallas\npects involved in Lawful I n k q d h are made easy. Our solution is safk,\nuser-Wly, and gives you an easy averview ofthe intempteddata.\n\nTIMELY WARNING\nTimeliness is of vital importance since notifications on individual target communication can be a matter of lie and death. As a defining\nfeature, the Evident solution provides timely waming when the system hits on userdefined triggering criteria. This could be e.g. when a\ncsp\nie\nfci\ntarget is calling or sending an email, etc. The warnings can\nbe sent by SMS or email, to the investigator in charge, or forwarded\nin real time to a cell phone or computer.\n\nThe 5 processes\nEVIDENT is based on modules from 5 core processes. You can\ndesign a unique solution that matches your requirements, for a\nspecific number of targets, or bandwidth requirements.\n\n-\n\n1.

In order to facilitate reliable, efficient,\nand lawful monitoring of all types of communication, including\nthe Internet, legislation is repeatedly changing. As a result,\nCommunications Service Providers (CSPs) are continually required to fulfill new legal obligations for Lawful lntercept (LI).\n\n-\n\nLlNC In brief\nH LlNC is ET1 Connect's concept for Lawful Interception.\n\nI\n\nH LlNC enables CSPs to fulfill their current and future\n\nlegal obligations for Lawful Interception.\nH LlNC is compliant with worldwide standards for Lawful\n\nInterception, including ETSl and CALEA (also known\nas ATISITIA).\n\nFLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS\nCSPs are obligated to monitor more and more services, for\nspecific targets and hand over this data to Law Enforcement\nAgencies (LEAS). As requirements tend to be vague, they are\ndifficult to manage by CSPs. To meet this challenge, ET1 Connect provides products and solutions enabling CSPs to comply\nwith their changing obligations, for the constantly changing requirements for Lawful Intercept.\n\nLAWFUL INTERCEPT NElWORK CONNECTOR\nTo meet the increasing requirements involved in IP monitoring,\nET1 Connect has produced the LlNC concept: Lawful lntercept\nNetwork Connector (LINC). LlNC is based on design criteria that\nbenefit all parties with regard to financial investment, time, and\nhuman resources.\n\nH The LlNC concept is based on a number of design\n\ncriteria, with a common focus of creating a Centralized\nLI Mediation system that benefits customers in terms\nof financial investment, time, and human resources.\n\nAbout ET1 Connect\nET1 Connect is a global provider of lawful intercept compliance systems, which enable reliable, efficient, and lawful monitoring of all types of communication. ET1 Connect is part of the ET1 Group - an international group of\ninnovative companies with worldwide leadership within\ndevelopment and production of advanced analysis and\nefficient monitoring solutions, for all types of data and\ntelecommunication networks.\n\nI\n\n\fET1 Connect\nI State-of-the-art communications monitoring\nl\n\nFINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION\nConsidering the huge amount of data that exists in modem CSP\nnetworks, it is a challenge for the CSP to identify, process, and\ndistribute only the required information to the Law Enforcement\nMonitoring Facility (LEMF).\n\nCUSTOMER NEEDS\nET1 Connect ~rovidessolutions to overcome these challenges\nthrough our LlNC product line. Development of all LlNC products\nhas been based on the needs and requirementsof our customers.\nThe result is a framework that can be tailored to meet the exact\nneeds of CSPs, globally.\n-\n\n'\nI\n\nWe believe...\n... ... that Lawful lntercept solutions should be\ntailored to the network - and not the other way\naround.\n\nWe recommend...\n... ... that Lawful lntercept solutions should be\nbased on features in the network elements,\nwhen possible.\n\n-\n\nET1 Group Experience\n\nI\n\nl\n\nCSP\n\n:\n\nET1 Connect\n\nLEMF\n\nET1 Group has more than 25 years of experience in developing and producing monitoring solutions. The past 15\nyears much of our focus has been within the realm of IP\nmonitoring solutions. Our forte is our state-of-the-art monitoring solutions, combined with an impressive global track\nrecord of meeting customer needs. This is why our customers continue to rely on ET1 for the mission critical task\nof monitoring.\n\n\fMANAGEMENT, MEDIATION & HANDOVER\n\nMEDIATION AND HANDOVER\n\nLlNC MediatorTMis the core of the LlNC concept. It is the central\ncomponent for management, control, and configuration of the\nentire system. Furthermore, LlNC MediatorTM\nperforms LI mediation and handover of product to the requesting Law Enforcement\nMonitoring Facility (LEMF).\n\nData mediation and handover are vital features of LI. LlNC MediatorTMverifies the received data according to warrant information, converts the data into a standard output format, as required\nby the individual LEA and subsequently distributes the data to\nthe LEMF. All processing is performed in real time, thus maintaining the ability to listen to audio and examine data \"live\". Distribution from LlNC MediatorTMto the LEMFs is compliant with\nETSI, CALEA (also known as ATIS/TIA) and other standards,\nas required.\n\nUSER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE\nLlNC DirectorTMprovides an intuitive and very easy to use interface for all system operations. This popular application simplifies\nday-to-day tasks as well as maintenance, initial set-up and configuration.\n\nCENTRALIZED SYSTEM\nLlNC MediatorTMallows for configuration of the various inputs\nrouters, switches, LlNC X-StreamTMprobes, or 3rd party equipment. Management of network elements, target set-up, distribution to the correct monitoring facilities, integrated audit, and optional billing of services is done via LlNC DirectorTM.\n\nFLEXIBLE INTERFACE\nLlNC MediatorTM\naccepts streaming input from network elements\nandlor probes, and may be further integrated with existing monitoring functionality. Regardless of origin and transport media, all\ndata is brought together in a single centralized system, for automated and converged distribution.\n\nThree handover interfaces\nThe unit provides all three handover interfaces: HII,\nH12, and H13 (Authorization Channel, CDC, CCC),\nbetween the LEMF and the Service Provider.\n\nBased on identification headers assigned during the acquisition\nphase, LlNC MediatorTM\ndetermines which LEMF should receive\nwhat data. In case data has to be delivered to multiple LEMFs,\nthe data is replicated without delay in the forwarding process.\nNote that it is also possible to deliver the same data in different\noutput formats, both streaming and file-based.\n\n\fScalable, flexible, and secure\n\nLlNC X-STREAMTM\n\nCONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn the event existing network equipment cannot provide the required LI functionality, the system may be further augmented\nwith probes, (LINC X-StreamTM).These probes passively interface to various line types, covering both WAN and LAN connections. Based on user-defined criteria, the LlNC X-StreamTM\nprobes acquire the requested data. Following acquisition, data\nis forwarded to the LlNC MediatorTM,which in turn distributes\nthe required information to the correct recipient.\n\nThe LlNC X-StreamTMprobe is currently available for the following line types:\nH STM1-16lOC3-48\n\nHIGH-PERFORMANCE ACQUISITION\nThe main task of the LlNC X-StreamTMprobe is to interface to\nvarious communication lines used to transport IP traffic. Furthermore, the unit processes the data and communication protocols (the protocol stack), to a point where data filtering can be\nperformed. Output is forwarded to the LlNC MediatorTM\nsystem,\nwhich in turn distributes the required information to the correct\nrecipients. The output can be either in filtered form, or presented as raw intercepted traffic, depending on the requirements.All\nmanagement of the LlNC X-StreamTM\nunits is done via the LlNC\nMediatorTM\nsystem.\n\nCALEA\n:OMPLIANl\n\n\nE T S l\n\nDMPLIANT\n\nH Ethernet 10110011000110G\n\nTo satisfy our customers' requirements and the challenges they\nface, we are committed to continuously developing LlNC XStreamTMunits, as new communication lines become available\nwithin the public networks.\n\nLive monitoring\nTimely delivery is a significant requirement faced by the\nCSP. This is accomplished by streaming data from LlNC\nX-StreamTM,\nor a network element , to the LlNC MediatorTM\n,\nand further on to the LEMF. This allows for l i e monitoring of\ninterceptedtraffic.\n\nENCRYPTION AND DIGITAL SIGNATURES\n\nOptionally, the transport of data - from the LlNC X-StreamTM\nunit to LlNC MediatorTMand subsequently to the LEMF - can\nbe-adjusted to meet local security requirements. This can be\nachieved by securing the transfer with enayption, for example\nlPs~cor other customer specific enayption. In addition to protecting data, digital signatures may be added, to authenticate\nand verify data.\n\n\fA\n\n.k.\n\nIndata retention\nMEETING TODAY'S REQUIREMENTS\nData Retention is an issue currently being focused on by various\nstandardization and legislation bodies, as CSps have requirements for retaining data.\n.\n\n.\n\nOVERVIEW OF NETWORK TRAFFIC\nData Retention basically refers to the monitoring of activities on a\ngiven network, without monitoring the actual content. Therefore,\nonly header information is used for logging of activity. This provides a historic as well as a current overview of network traffic.\nET1 Connect has already made major advances in this field, and\nour LlNC products can meet these challenges.\n\nwill be supported in our Data Retention solution. The logged information is specific for each of the categories and contains data\nSuch as log-on, authentication User name, assigned and used IP\naddresses, frorn/to/cc e-mail addresses, URLs visited, and date1\ntime of activity. Furthermore, the solution enables decoding of\nnumerous protocols, including webmail, ensuring compliance to\nboth current and future requirements for retaining data.\n\nDATA LOGGING\nFurthermore, services will be implemented as legislation is accepted in each country, and as ET1 Connect has extensive knowledge about data logging in general. Providing a secure and reliable system in numerous countries is part of our strategy.\n\nEXTENSIVE CAPABILITIES\nOur current solution includes the capability to log and monitor:\nH Overall network activities\nH Activities for specific IP addresses\n\n. . .\n. . .\n-- -\n\nH Traftic based on other user-defined parameters\n\nMore specifically, ET1 Connect is focusing on four main data\ncategories, defined as ISP Data, E-mail Data, Web Activity, and\nother services, such as webmail, Instant Message, and P2P, that\n\nProtecting your network\nLlNC offers comprehensivestatistical analysis and viewing\nof monitored data. This enables you to identify and track\nchanges in traffic patterns, right down to a specific user.\nIn addition to fulfilling LEA requirements, Data Retention is\na valuable tool for CSPs to monitor misuse, unauthorized\naccess, andlor malicious activity, so steps can be taken to\nprotect their networks.\n\n\fVALUABLE PARTNERSHIPS\nThrough partnerships with leading manufacturers of network\nequipment, ET1 Connect ensures seamless integration between\na CSP's existing network elements and LlNC Mediator (i.e. our\nmediation and handover devices). This limits investment and ensures easy implementationof the LlNC products in the networks;\nthus, customers do not need to upgrade existing network equipment to comply with legal requirements.\n\nAs an additional part of the overall solution, ET1 develops and\nsupplies complete LEMFs that include tools for meeting the\nchallenges of extensive IP monitoring. ETl's LEMF platform is\nmade in an open format, giving our customers the best of ETl's\nexpertise. Although the LlNC concept can be used with any kind\nof LEMF, as delivery of data from the LlNC MediatorTMis in a\nstandardized format, we recommend taking advantage of ETl's\nextensive knowledge and decades of experience in data processing, storage, and presentation.\n\nCOST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION\nCSPs can save significant resources by utilizing ET1 Connect's\nsolutions. The flexibility of ET1 Connect's solutions ensures that\nfuture CSP needs are met. Furthermore our flexible solutions\nare cost-effective, as new ET1 Connect units interface with the\nones that already exist (and future products).\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nINTELLIGENT ACQUISITION\nFor existing equipment, our concept provides central management and mediation, as the LlNC MediatorTMsub-system\nis designed to set up target data on both ET1 and third party\nequipment. ET1Connect's acquisition units are highly intelligent,\nnetwork independent, easy-to-install, and user-friendly. The result is a straightforward technical implementation of ET1 Connect solutions in the network.\n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn the ever-evolving industry of data and telecommunication,the\ngoal of ET1 Connect is to fulfil1 the diversified requirements of\nour customers by solving their real needs.

It is a multi-purpose\nadministration program designed for central administration and\ncustomized configuration of the monitoring system, warrants,\nand system users.\nEVIDENT Director's design and development is based on\ninput from experienced administrators. Consequently, it is\ncharacterised by structured overviews and offers a complete\nmanagement system with target, user, hardware, and status\n\nManagement features\nm CASEWARRANT MANAGEMENT\nElectronic handling of all interception\nwarrants.

Users are also able to\nspecify the data output format, when relevant.\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT\nEVIDENT has fully automated, built-in Information\nLifecycle Management (ILM).\n\nm SYSTEM MANAGEMENT\nFor technical administratorswho maintain the\noperation of the system.\n\nUSERS AND PROFILES\nUsers and user profiles are created and maintained in EVIDENT\nDirector. This allows the administrator to determine user access\n(i.e. what a user is able to open, see, and do). The application\nalso performs audit of all database transactions and user activity.\n\nm SYSTEM AUDIT\nThe solution audits all user actions and ensures\nsecurity and transparency.\n\n-1\n\n\nl\n\ni\n\n<\n\n\fEVIDENT Dir\nUser-friendly system management\n\n/\n\nTECHNICAL FEATURES\nEVIDENT Director is the only tool needed for administration of\nall EVIDENT X-Stream hardware units and system users. The\nsystem has a workflow where the user within seconds can get an\noverview of the daily activities, e.g. intercepts, hardware, users,\netc. In addition to configuration and maintenance of hardware\nunits, EVIDENT Director is primarily used to set up target\nselection criteria.\n\nUser profiles\nm SUPERUSER\n\nHas access to all Director functions except audit.\nm INTERCEPTION ADMINISTRATOR\n\nIs allowed to create and edit interceptions, view\nsystem alarms, and assign data management rules to\ninterceptions.\n\nMONITOR THE TARGET\nEVIDENT Director enables the operator to define interceptions,\nand arrange deployment of the monitoring equipment. Its\nstructured overviews facilitate the work process and structures\nthe acquired information. Easy access to vital information\nensures an efficient workflow.\n\nSYSTEM AUDIT AND TRANSPARENCY\nHaving access to large amounts of sensitive information, it\nis of vital importance that the collected data is protected from\nmisuse. System audits ensure that the data is handled according\nto national legislation and merely is available to personnel\naccording to their assigned roles.\n\nUSER MANAGEMENT\nA user-friendly wizard enables the Super User (one of EVIDENT\n\nDirector's profiles) to easily assign profiles to persons or groups,\naccording to the level of access their role allows them.\n\nm TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATOR\nIs allowed to add and maintain system units, create\nand edit interceptions, view system alarms, and assign\ndata management rules to interceptions.\nm USER AND INTERCEPTION ADMINISTRATOR\nIs allowed to create and edit interceptions, manage\nusers and user profiles, view alarms and assign data\nmanagement rules to interceptions.\nm DATA MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATOR\n\nIs allowed to create and edit data management rules.\nm AUDIT ADMINISTRATOR\nIs the only user who has access to the audit functions\nbut has no access to other functions.\n\n\fTARGET SELECTION CRITERIA\n\nTarget selection criteria\n\nSelection criteria management in EVIDENT Director is intuitive\nand facilitates correct and easy collection. The Director\napplication has a wide range of predefined templates for, e.g. IP\naddresses, MAC addresses, etc.\n\nm\n\nEASY WORKFLOW\n\nm Ethernet VLAN\n\nTarget selection criteria can be logically grouped by the\nadministrator, e.g. selection criteria belonging to a certain case,\nactivity, etc. To optimizethe daily workflow, target selection criteria\ncan be saved as defaults, including distribution information,\nhandover formats etc., so the administratordoes not have to start\nover every time a new target is set up. The administrator can\nalso upload files to associate, import, and integrate external data\nrelated to a particular case or warrant.\n\nE-mail address\n\nm Ethernet mac address\n\nm\n\nIP address\n\nm\n\nPhonelfax number\n\nm User login name\nm\n\nVolP phone number\n\nm Webmail login name\nm IMElllMSl\n\nDISTRIBUTION\nDistribution of target selection criteria to specific CSPs is\ncontrolled from EVIDENT Director. The selection of recipients\nof the intercepted data is also controlled here. Whenever a\ntarget selection criterion is distributed, the administrator will\nreceive confirmation whether or not the criterion was distributed\nsuccessfully.\n\n-\n\nDIRECTOR TODAY HERE & NOW\nIn the Director Today view, the administrator can see what target\nselection criteria are generating hits and the number of hits that\nare being generated.\n\nIf permitted by national law, the following interception\ncriteria can also be applied:\nChat nickname, chat keywords, chat present, e-mail\npresent, e-mail keywords in body, e-mail keywords in\nsubject, Ethernet VLAN, FTP login name, FTP present,\nimport (e.g. PCAP), user present, VolP participant,\nVolP present, web post, web present web URL,\nwebmail login name, etc.\n\n\fControl\nOverview\ninterceptions\nUser-friendly\n\nManage\n\nSECURE data management\n\nStructure\n\n\fEasy workflow and user administration\n\nm\n\n\fEVIDENT Directo,\nManage the monitoring facility\n\nComplete overview of all adions\nperformed in EVIDENT Director\nor by EVIDENT Investigator\nusers.

Eni operates in all of the\nfollowing aspects of innovation: technological monitoring, case\nmethod studies, applied research, technology development and\nthe application of technological innovation to business.\nThe principle of \"knowledge as an asset\" is one of the key elements\nin Eni's knowledge management strategy. For many years, the\ncompany has dedicated particular attention to the methods and\ntechniques of content analysis, as well as to the evolution of\ntechnological support platforms.\n\nThe objectives\nTo satisfy the needs of “non-conventional” searches and go\nbeyond the limits of keyword searches by applying a research\nmodel based on semantic technology\nTo increase the value of intellectual capital by improving the\ninteraction between knowledge workers\nTo provide a solution to make information access flexible and\nadaptable to meet Eni's specific needs (for example, the need\nto identify the “solutions” to “problems” within a document)\nTo monitor external sources of information, in particular, the\nactivities of the competition and documents containing\ntechnological or copyright information\n\nWhy Eni chose Expert System\nKnowledge is the basis for all of Eni's development and competitive\nactivities. Therefore, the company needed solutions which could\nguarantee fast, effective and efficient management of information.\nThe challenge was to revolutionize the very concept of knowledge:\nit is not just a collection of information, but a group of connections.\nEni's strategic data is mostly of the non-structured type, such as:\nnews articles, web pages (from competitors' websites, for example)\nand specific documents (patents, work-related memos), etc...These\nkinds of text are rarely structured, meaning they are not usually\nfound organized in a database. This situation makes analysts and\nknowledge workers' tasks quite laborious. The systems which are\ntraditionally used to handle non-structured information (such as\nkeyword search engines, instruments for information retrieval, etc.)\ndo not consider the meanings of phrases expressed in a text. They\nhave been proven to be inefficient for analyzing large quantities\nof text because they are unable to understand what is discussed\nwithin a document, and are thus incapable of distinguishing useful\ndata from irrelevant data.\nSemantic technology focuses on the meanings of terms and is\ncharacterized by its ability to focus on the content (topics, concepts,\nnoteworthy entities), regardless of how it may be expressed. Hence,\nthis technology can guarantee greater effectiveness and efficiency\nin search activities (faceted searches and SAO), as well as in\nintelligence processes (marketing and competitive intelligence).\n\nEni is a market leader in the energy sector.\nIt's main objective is to grow in the activities\nof research, production, transportation,\ntransformation and commercialization of oil\nand natural gas.\n\nMarket Area\nEnergy\nThe challenge\nTo provide a solution capable of\nsearching and analyzing documents\nTo access information in a precise\nand complete manner\nTo organize information so that it is\nuniform and readily available\nTo provide a complete solution for\nthe selection, the organization, the\ncorrelation and the evaluation of the\ninformation at the basis of intelligence\nprocesses\n\nThe results\nAn instrument which is close to the\nuser's “mind”, able to highlight the\nexisting connections and relations\nwithin information\nTargeted access to documents;\nsearching not just by keywords, but\nalso by headwords and concepts and\nby person, place, company\nAutomatic extraction of categories\nand entities, navigation via facets\nand SAO searches\nConstant monitoring of external\ninformation and a complete solution\nfor intelligence activities\n\n\fCase history\nThe solutions\nCOGITO® Focus, Expert System's semantic software for\nthe strategic search and analysis of information\nCOGITO® Intelligence Platform, Expert System's suite\nfor the efficient and automatic management of large quantities\nof data (text and audio)\n\nHow they work\nExpert System provided Eni with Cogito Focus, an engine for\nthe strategic search and analysis of information. Thanks to\nthe advantages of semantic technology (the comprehension\nof phrase structures and meanings of words, e.g.: is a jaguar\nan animal or an automobile?), Cogito Focus is now the main\ninstrument used to manage Eni's entire, internal mass of\ninformation.\nFocus gives the user immediate access to the data which is\nalready structured within a database, as well as to the\nunstructured documents (articles, e-mails, Web pages, etc.).\nIt is the ideal solution for searching through patent documents,\nfor example, because it follows an approach which is similar\nto the user's mental process, which typically tries to find\n“solutions” to “problems” within the document. This type of\nlogic is similar to the characteristics of patent documents,\nwhich treat innovation using “problem toward solution”\ncriteria.\n\nMarket Area\nEnergy\nBenefits\nA reduction in the costs and time related\nto information access; a reduction in the\nsense of frustration often linked to the\ninability to find information\nAn increase in value and sharing of\nintellectual capital\nAutomatic monitoring of markets and\ncompetition; support in all phases of\nintelligence processes\n\nBefore\nThe traditional search engine was\nincapable of handling the information\noverload\nDifficulties in using the documents already\non hand, there was no way to understand\n(in a timely manner) what kind of\nknowledge was already available\nTraditional marketing and competitive\nintelligence activities\n\nAfter\n\nCogito Intelligence Platform is well-integrated with information\nactivities and offers complete support to aid the decisionmaking process.

The information they seek is now available and accessible from anywhere and at anytime,\nthanks to the Internet, smartphones and advanced technology.\nExpert System has developed a software called COGITO® Answers which combines the potentials\nof Natural Language Processing with semantic analysis in order to improve the interaction between\nlocal government and its citizens. Designed for mobile devices, the simple interfaces allow citizens\nto send a text message (in everyday language) to their local government, their healthcare provider,\nthe transportation system, etc... For example, users can ask, \"What's showing at the cinema this\nevening?\". The system will automatically process the request and send back an answer in real\ntime.\nThis service functions thanks to Cogito Answers' semantic software which automatically understands\nthe meanings of words and phrases and precisely analyzes the language we normally use to\ncommunicate.\n\nCogito Answers: the convenient new Mobile Government solution\nwhich gives citizens the information they need\n- when they need it.\n\n\fCase Study: COsmOs\nCOsmOs uses Expert System's Cogito Answers software to\nprovide an innovative text message information service for\nthe citizens of Trentino.\nThe service is offered by the Consorzio dei Comuni Trentini\nand involves numerous institutions as well as over 40\ntownships in the Trentino area. The synergy gained from\nthese collaborative efforts helps to provide citizens with an\nexclusive solution which is the only one of its kind among\nlocal Italian governments.\nCitizens can send text messages everyday, 24 hours a day,\nto 3338888188 and ask a question in everyday language.\nNo predefined, hard-to-remember codes are needed. The\nsystem will identify the relevant context and automatically\nsend an answer back to the user's cellphone.\nCOsmOs is a constantly growing system and aims to do\nmuch more than just provide updated information. Research\nis currently underway to find new ways to apply this efficient\ntool of Mobile Government to improve the quality of service\nfor tourists in Trentino.\nCOsmOs currently provides information about offices, traffic,\nevents, payments, healthcare services, pharmacies, weather,\npublic transportation, etc...\n\nBenefits\nCOsmOs lets citizens access content\nof interest in a way that is:\n- Simple and user-friendly: with\nnatural language interfaces\n- Quick: answers are received within\nseconds\n- Precise: the system extracts the\nanswers from a constantly updated\ndatabase\n- Interactive: any cellphone or\nsmartphone can be used\n- Automatic: no operators are\nneeded because the system alone\ninterprets the requests 24/7\n- Economical: the service cost is the\nsame as for a normal text message\n\nEvery month, COsmOs\nprocesses nearly 12,500 sms\n\nInteract with government\nthrough text messages:\nExpert System's semantic software\nat the Shanghai Expo 2010\nExpert System is among the winners of Italy of Innovators, an event in which the top Italian technologies were\nselected for the Shanghai Expo 2010.

Equally important is the ability to filter data to further refine and\nenhance discovery in any set of results.\nCOGITO® Search Explore Engine improves access to content and, through the automatic comprehension of text, is able to generate the meaningful data necessary for business intelligence.\nTraditional search methods based on keywords or statistical algorithms are unable to provide complete results and often require more time and manual intervention because they are limited by\ntheir inability to understand the meaning of content or words in context.\nToday’s search and knowledge management requires technology that not only keeps up with the\nconstant increase in information output, but is able to take any volume of data or information and\napply advanced functionalities to help you find exactly what you need, when you need it.\nCogito SEE combines the benefits of automatic text comprehension (semantics) with an innovative\nfunctionality and an intuitive, user friendly interface to respond to these requirements. Cogito SEE\nmakes the activities of search, analysis and interactive exploration not only easier, but faster and\nmore precise.\nBenefits:\nA unique point of access to\nstructured and unstructured\ndata.\nA simple interface that\nenables intuitive and visual\nnavigation and exploration of\nresults, tags and facets.\nInteraction with search results\nto discover new connections,\nlists of data or relational maps\nwithout initiating a new search.\nSearch capability for\nMultilanguage content.\nAutomatic report generation\nto monitor and share evolving\ndetails and results.\n\nExtract concepts and filter results. As part of the text analysis\nprocess, Cogito can automatically extract entities, events and other\nrelevant concepts and generate an interactive graphic for\nvisualizing and filtering results.\n\nAdvanced visualization of\nresults through tags, clouds and\nrelational maps.\n\n\fA dynamic update of\nresults. The treemap\ngraphic summarizes the\ninformation included in a\nsearch data stream.\nEach topic is\nrepresented in a\ndifferent color, the\nfrequency of similar\ndocuments are\nrepresented by the size\nof the square, and the\nshade of color\ndistinguishes the most\nrecent news from older\nevents.\n\nKey Features\nCogito SEE revolutionizes access to information, enabling companies to perform complex analysis with the\nsame ease of basic search: From the precise and accurate identification of information, to the selection,\nextraction and integration of structured and unstructured information. It includes:\nData Acquisition. Indexes documents from diverse internal or external sources (structured and\nunstructured), and enables predefined criteria.\nSemantic Search and Sentiment Analysis. Cogito SEE guarantees optimal performance in terms of\nprecision (excluding useless information that could cloud results) and recall (the ability to provide all of the\nresults of interest). It also supplies the most advanced analysis functionality for the assessment of\nsentiment.\nSemantic Intelligence Agents. Allows users to intelligently filter the acquired information so that only\nthe most relevant data is analyzed. Customized filters provide updates and alerts for specific documents of\ninterest.\nExtraction and Correlation. It extracts, normalizes and automatically associates specific metadata\nfrom the analyzed texts (people, companies, places, addresses, dates, amounts, etc.), thus simplifying the\nsearch and highlighting connections and patterns that emerge between data.\nInteractive Analysis and Navigation via Facets. Allows the interactive examination of documents,\nenabling the creation of new facets based on findings from data exploration.\nSubject-Action-Object Search. Enables more precise search through the understanding of logical\nroles of words within phrases. For example, using the subject government, Cogito SEE will also display all\nthe related verbs (to debate, to vote, to elect) as well as all of the related direct objects (laws, citizens,\nelections) that could be used to form sentences with the selected concept.\nReporting and Extraction. Advanced semantic filters allow users to prepare intelligence and\ncompetitive reports for diverse functional areas such as Finance, Marketing or R&D.\nVisualization and Integration with Maps. The semantic functionality of Cogito SEE is easily\nintegrated into relational and geographical maps, and clearly displays connections and relations between\nentities.\nEXPERT SYSTEM\nExpert System is the leading provider of semantic software that discovers,\nclassifies and interprets text information. All Expert System products, which\n®\nare based on the patented technology COGITO , leverage the company's\nexpertise in the development of business solutions that support the\nactivities of Knowledge Management, Customer Care and Intelligence.\nwww.expertsystem.net\n\n\f",

This read can then be run through\nadvanced software tools to decode the hexadecimal data and produce an evidential report.\nThough easy to describe, this process can be time consuming and highly specialised\nrequiring skilled engineers to perform the task.\n\nUseless for evidence?\n\nChip-off techniques mean 'not necessarily!'\n\nI\nQ 201 1 Forenslc Telecommun~cat~ons\nServices Ltd\n\nPage 6 of l 4\n\nCcWENTW\n\nwww.Forens~cTS.corn\n\n\fDate: 31103111\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n5.0\n\n-\n\nForensic Acquisition for Apple iPhonem and iPod Touchm iXAMm & iXAMiner\n\nThe Apple iPhonem offers an advanced multimedia experience that integrates cutting edge\nphone, web and media functions in one device.

The identities of these\nphones are often unknown, for example a Pay As You Go phone purchased for cash. Not\nbeing able to readily identify users and the phone identity through normal methods poses\nsignificant problems for law enforcement agencies.\nThe FTS Seeker Handset Identifier/Locator provides an easily deployed, cost effective,\nsystem for establishing the identity of mobile phones in a specific area. The unit can recover\nboth the handset identity (IMEI) and the SIM card identity (IMSI). These can subsequently be\nused to check Billing Records from the Network Operator, as well as being used for\ntarget location and to detect SIM card swapping.\nTools of this type are, of necessity, deployed in potentially hostile areas, very close to a\ntarget. Covert operation is therefore of vital importance both to avoid detection by targets\nand to protect the safety of the operator. This system has been specifically designed with\nthese requirements in mind, so that it may be easily operated and carried in a variety of\nconcealments, for example a shoulder bag or rucksack. It also uses a rugged form of\nconstruction to withstand the rough treatment that is inevitable during operations of this\ntype. The device can be deployed both inside and outside of a vehicle.\n\nFeatures:\nUltra compact and easily portable system.\nRugged construction in sealed casing.\nBackpack / Shoulder Bag or brief case deployment.\nWireless user interface via PDA, Smart-Phone, Laptop or Netbook.\nOperationally simple to use by non technical personnel.\nCost effective alternative to vehicle based systems.\nDual base stations for'high speed operation -scan two networks at once.\nEmbedded receiver for fast network survey.\nAutomatic scan of multiple Networks (two at a time).\nPowerful built in database with removable media store.\nTotally silent operation using all solid state electronics.\nBuilt in software for lMSl catching identifyingwhich network or country lMSl is from.\nBuilt in software for IMEl identity of handset make and model.\nSelf contained, operates from internal batteries.\nSimple download of results to a laptop for detailed analysis.\nGPS facility - coordinates stored of where unit is deployed.\nWhite list' function, to ignore 'friendly' IMSI/IMEl1s.\nUser benefits:\nFast, efficient, cost effective lMSl grabbing.\nDirectional antennas focus target area.\nUser \"Mark\" facility for logging of visual information.\nSimple target identity analysis using database.\nEasily concealed for covert operation.\nSupports target location.\nAdjustable grabbing times.\n\n3 201 1 Forensic Telecommunications Services Ltd\n\nPage 11 of14\n\n\fCONFIDENTIAL\n\nDate: 31/03/11\n\nBuilding a digital forensics laboratory\nWith digital forensics laboratories across the United Kingdom and overseas, FTS analyse\nmany tens of thousands of devices each year.

This\nis achieved using FTS' dedicated extraction software\nwhich, in many cases can produce highly detailed results\nincluding raw co-ordinates accurate to within 15cm. The\nrange of data recoverable varies between devices but\ncan include journey logs, planned routes, vehicle speeds\nat given times, and bearings (direction of travel).\nAll this information can be plotted using FT9 custom mapping solution and forms part of a\ncomprehensive post examination report produced to IS09001:2000 quality standards.\n\n1b9\n\nTomTom@(allcurrent models)\nRecover home locations, favourites, recent destinations and stored routes, both live\n(accessible by manual\nexamination) and historic (only accessible from memory analysis by X-NAV software).\nPlease note: These are not time and date stamped.\n\nA manual examination will only retrieve a maximum of 24 recent destinations from the\ndevice. With X-NAV software the recovery of considerably more is possible. The highest\nnumber X-NAV has achieved is 1700 destinations. If the SatNav has been paired to a\nBluetooth enabled mobile phone; even without the recovery of that mobile, FTS can identify\nthe phone, extract its call registers (not including times and dates), phonebook, possibly text\nmessages with times and dates. X-NAV can also recover live and historic data including\nphone name, model and Bluetooth address.\nGarminm/ NavMan\nSimilar to TomTomQ.However, X-NAV can currently only extract 'live' and not deleted data.\nLinked mobile phone information including core data and call registers can also be\nconfirmed.\nWindows Mobilem Devices and Pocket PC PDAs\nMost devices store raw data from the satellites so it is possible to plot where the device was\nactually located.\nSometimes analysis identifies times and dates, enabling the recovery of overview maps and\nother historic data. One such examination undertaken by X-NAV recovered 600 maps.\nPlease note: Some Windows MobileW/PDAdevices use TomTomQnavigation software. In\nthese cases X-NAV is able to retrieve the same level of GPS data as under TomTom'.\n\nStandard forensic analysis of the PDA device itself will also reveal all available telephony\ndata (call registers, phonebook, speed dialling numbers, SMS and MMS messages), plus all\nPDA data (appointments, tasks, notes, e-mail messages, media files and documents).\n\n.32011 Forensic Telecommunications Services Ltd.\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\n\fCONFIDENTIAL\n\n10.0\n\nDate: 31/03/11\n\nSpecialist equipment\nFTS maintain a portfolio of specialist intelligence products and services including;\nInterception range ovewiew;\n\nm\n\nm\n\no\n\nAnalogue telephone interception\n\no\n\nAnalogue interception with call routing\n\no\n\nSwitchILI software dial-up receiving\n\no\n\nDigital trunk interception\n\no\n\nGSM interception\n\no\n\nPBX monitoring\n\no\n\nCall playback\n\no\n\nModem decoding (dial-up internet)\n\no\n\nBroadband interception\n\no\n\nFax processing\n\no\n\nMapping\n\nSatellite phone interception;\no\n\nThuraya Tactical or Strategic monitoring systems\n\no\n\nIridium Monitoring & Decoding System IMDS - Tactical or Strategic systems\n\nGhost phones (Nokia and LG) & coded phones\nJammers\nDirectional microphone system\no\n\nFeatures an array of high quality miniature microphones and state of the art\ndigital signal processing technology t o produce the most sophisticated\nmicrophone of its type anywhere in the world\n\nCDR collection and analysis system\nThe system is designed to be part of a National/Regional Monitoring System that is\nfully capable of targeting TelecommunicationsTraftic and suspects in any particular\nregion -or to look for their electronic association of suspects in ANY area across the\nnation and their supporters, funders or overseas associates.\nGSM location and tracking system\no\n\no\n\nThe LTS provides the ability to locate GSM mobile devices on request and the ability\nto perform\ntracking of these devices over a period of time.

    "text": "LAWFUL INTERCEPTION:\nA MOUNTING CHALLENGE FOR\nSERVICE PROVIDERS AND GOVERNMENTS\n\n\fExecutive Summary\nLawful interception is the legally grounded process by which a communications network operator or\nservice provider gives authorised officials access to the communications of individuals or\norganisations.\nThe regulatory mandates for lawful interception have evolved over the years, but owing to\ninternational co-operation, far reaching standardisation has been achieved. Most countries in the\nworld share the view that legal interception must be standards-based in order to achieve\ninteroperability and smooth co-operation between the Police and operators and between the police\nforces of different countries. Standards also enable lower costs of products and ensure adequate data\nprotection.\nMost countries in the world have some sort of regulation in place that covers interception. We\ndistinguish between heavily regulated countries and countries with emerging legislation. In all heavily\nregulated countries, network and service providers have a statutory obligation to ensure and\nmaintain interception capabilities. They must be able to intercept all applicable communications of a\ncertain target without any gaps in coverage, and they must provide a network to transmit the\nintercepted information to the Police.\nTraditionally, lawful interception was straightforward and uncomplicated because it was confined to\ncircuit-switched networks carrying voice traffic. Meanwhile, the communication patterns have\nchanged. Today’s lawbreakers have a wide range of sophisticated, encrypted communication channels\navailable to them, and with the changing communication patterns, the scope of interception has\nwidened. The trend is unmistakable: service providers will be required to support law enforcement\nand intelligence gathering with an increasing amount of data across the entire array of service\nofferings and technologies.\nThe challenges facing network operators and service providers are such that they cannot meet the\nfundamental requirements of lawful interception without dedicated lawful interception solution. From\nthe perspective of the network operator or service provider, the primary obligations and general\nrequirements for developing and deploying a lawful interception solution are: Cost effectiveness;\nminimal impact on the network infrastructure; compatibility and compliance; support of future\ntechnologies; reliability; and security.\nIn most countries, each operator will deploy its own lawful interception solution, but in countries\nwith emerging regulation, where the individual operators have yet to build up (or upgrade) their\ninterception capabilities, an umbrella systems makes a lot of sense. An umbrella system is a single,\nintegrated lawful interception system that covers all or several operators in a country.\nThere are many valid lawful interception solutions on the market. The best way to introduce best\npractice is to partner with a solution vendor with many years of experience of designing and\nimplementing lawful interception solutions. A good solution should interface with as many network\nelements as possible and support all standards. Operators should consider the long-term implications\nof the investment, as they will need regular updates and support and must adapt to future\nrequirements. The long-term perspective makes it important to partner with a vendor to whom\nlawful interception is fundamental part of the product offering, and who is likely to be around in the\nlong run.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fTable of Contents\nThe “Lawfulness” of Lawful Interception

Interception\n“Interception” is an ancient concept – at least as old as the postal system – and we can safely assume\nthat a systematic interception of messages will have been organised already at the time of the\nEmperor Augustus. Today, a modern scholarly definition of “lawful interception” is that it is the\nlegally grounded process by which a provider of networks and/or communications services gives\nauthorised officials access to the communications of individuals or organisations.\n\nStandardisation and International Co-operation\nThe United States were pioneers of lawful interception when the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe\nStreets Act was introduced in 1968. Since then, the Western countries have worked together to\ndevelop the LI concept. The European Council resolution from 19951 – which forms the basis of all\nmodern EU implementations of lawful interception – was a result of European governments working\ntogether with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA.\nOwing to this international co-operation, far reaching standardisation has been achieved, and most\ncountries in the world share the view that legal interception must be standards-based. Many\nstandards have been adopted or emulated by many more countries than the ones that had originally\nsponsored their development. The international co-operation to define standards has had four\nobjectives:\n• Achieving interoperability and smooth co-operation between LEAs and operators as well as\ncodifying the separation of duties between LEAs and operators;\n• Enabling lower costs of products;\n• Facilitating international co-operation between LEAs; and\n• Ensuring adequate data protection\nETSI\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) enjoys a leading role in standardisation,\nnot only in Europe but world-wide.\nETSI has been a major driver\nbehind the specification of handover interfaces and of the flow\nthat intercepted data should\nfollow. It specifies a general\narchitecture for lawful interception that allows systematic\nand extensible communication\nbetween network operators and\nLEAs over defined interfaces and\nin compliance with national\nlegislation.\nThis general architecture applies\nto any kind of circuit- or packetswitched voice and data network.\n\nCOUNCIL RESOLUTION of 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications (96/C\n329/01)\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fUnder the terms of the ETSI standards, compliance is achieved by meeting the requirements for all\nprovisions of lawful interception, and, in particular, the requirements for the Handover Interfaces\n(HIs) to the LEAs. Mandatory compliance with this ETSI standard has been enacted in a number of\ncountries.\n3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\nIn addition to the ETSI specifications, a consortium of technology organisations called the 3rd\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined the technical specifications for lawful interception\nin 3G and future mobile networks. The standards 3GPP TS 33.106-108, establish a compliance\nframework that has been embraced by many industry participants.\nThe 3GPP agreement, formalised towards the end of 1998, includes input from ETSI, the Association\nof Radio Industries and Businesses/Telecommunication Technology Committee (ARIB/TTC) in Japan,\nCCSA China, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) in North America, and\nthe Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA) in South Korea.\nANSI/ATIS\nATIS, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, which is a work group under the\nAmerican standardisation institution (ANSI), has defined a number of interception standards that help\nnetwork operators and service providers comply with CALEA – one of the four US laws that\nregulate lawful interception – passed in 1994 in order to help the US government foster interaction\nwith network operators to make wiretapping easier. Solutions compliant with ANSI/ATIS standards\nprovide a ‘Safe Harbour’ for the fulfilment of the LI obligations of the US network operators and\nservice providers. This interaction was necessary due to the growth in new types of communications,\nlike wireless phones and e-mail, along with rapid advances in technology. CALEA has been relatively\nsuccessful and operators have been co-operative.\nATIS has published new standards for broadband Internet access and VoIP services, as well as\nupdates to existing standards for voice and CDMA interception.\nCableLabs (PacketCable)\nPacketCable standards by CableLabs provide the standards for hybrid fibre-coax networks used by\ncable television companies to provide telecommunications services (e.g. internet access, VoIP). LI\nstandards provided by CableLabs are the de-facto standard for these types of networks,\npredominantly in the Americas.\nSORM\nSORM-1 was a Russian system, established in 1996 to monitor telephone communications. It was\nreplaced in 1998 by SORM-2 to allow the monitoring of the internet, in addition to telephone\ncommunications.\n\nNational Regulation around the World\nThe majority of the World’s countries have a legal framework in place that regulates interception.\nOften those legal frameworks consist of several acts of parliament, directives and other legal texts (in\nthe USA, for example, there are four main laws).\nWhere lawful interception is heavily regulated, the regulatory mandates are fairly similar, whereas the\nsituation for network and service providers is materially different in countries with emerging or no\nregulation.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fHeavily Regulated Countries\nIn all heavily regulated countries, network and service providers have a statutory obligation to ensure\nand maintain interception capabilities. They must be able to intercept all applicable communications\nof a certain target without any gaps in coverage, and they must provide a network to transmit the\nintercepted information to the LEAs.\nReliability and integrity\nThe network and service\nproviders must deliver precise\nand accurate results with the\nhighest levels of data integrity.\nThe interception capabilities\nmust be as reliable as the\nservice(s) to be intercepted,\nand all interception activities\nmust be recorded and logged.\n\nSeparation of\nIntercepted Data\nCommunications data should\nbe divisible into individual\ncomponents; for example, the\nmetadata included in the Interception Related Information\n(IRI) should be separable from\nthe communication content\n(CC).\n\nTransparent Surveillance\nThe target must not be able to\ndetect that he or she is being\nmonitored.\n\nAll countries allow legal interception in relation to serious crime such as murder, kidnapping and\nhijacking, to aid the police in investigating and construction a prosecution case. Most countries now\nalso allow the monitoring of criminal behaviour, especially relating to suspected terrorism and mafia\nactivity.\nWhite-collar crime is an interesting case. Some heavily regulated countries (e.g. the USA) allow\nlawful interception in relation to computer fraud and financial offences; some countries (e.g. Italy)\nmake widespread use of lawful interception to fight corruption; and others again (e.g. Russia)\nexplicitly allow lawful interception to combat tax fraud.\nImmediate\nActivation and\nReal-time\nResponsiveness\nFollowing the receipt\nof a warrant, the\ninterception,\nmust\nbe activated within a\nfew hours, and the\nnetwork and service\nproviders\nmust\nensure\nreal-time\ndelivery of the intercepted data.\n\nSufficient\nCapacity\nThe network and\nservice\nproviders\nmust have adequate\ncapacity to handle\nthe scope and scale\nof all warranted\nactivities. The UK,\nfor\nexample,\nrequires capacity to\nintercept 1 in every\n10,000 subscribers.\n\nData Security and\nPrivacy\nNetwork and service\nproviders\nmust\nprotect\nsensitive\ndata\nduring\ninterception\nand\ntransmission. They\nmust safeguard an\nindividual’s records.\n\nDecryption\nNetwork and service\nproviders\nmust\ndeliver\nencrypted\ncontent in plain text\nformat if the encryption keys are\navailable to them.\n\nOther differences from country to country involve the communication services for which network\nand service providers must maintain interception capabilities. In Europe, the requirement is to\nintercept the access to the networks (circuit-switched or packet switched) plus some services (e.g.\nSMS, VoIP and e-mail), but not all kinds of other Internet services ... yet. It is up to the LEA to\nextract the application data (services) from the IP data. In Germany, a warrant typically remains in\nforce for just 3 months, whereas a Swedish warrant can last 11 months. UK law stresses the\nresponsibilities of the police forces and prevents most intercepted content from being used as\nevidence.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fCountries with Emerging Regulation\nDifferent countries have different political traditions in relation to privacy and the rights of citizens,\nbut a complete absence of interception regulation is incompatible with a modern democratic society.\nDuring the last few years, the rate of adoption of new technology in many parts of the world has\nexploded (in the Arab world, for example, the rate of adoption has doubled), but the legislative\nframework of those countries has not necessarily kept up.\nThis is now beginning to change. We are seeing a tendency for increasingly comprehensive regulation\nto emerge in countries that have not previously had any. Frost & Sullivan believes that this tendency\nwill continue, because one of the main drivers behind regulation and standardisation is\ndemocratisation and an enhancement of the general democratic understanding of people around the\nWorld.\nWhere new regulation emerges, it follows international standards and established principles.\nLebanon, for example, in 2009, implemented new lawful interception legislation “The\nTelecommunication Interception Act”. The Lebanese Act establishes that the interception of\ntelecommunications requires a judicial or administrative decision. Namibia is an example of an\nAfrican country that has recently done the same. The regulation follows the direction given by the\ncountry’s Information Technology Policy, published in September 2008, in which lawful interception\nfeatures very prominently.\nIndia is an interesting example of a country whose legislation is out of date. The Indian supreme\ncourt attorney and technology legal expert Praveen Dalal considers that India has no constitutionally\nsound lawful interception law, because telephone tapping is still regulated by a law that goes back to\nthe days of British rule, the Indian Telegraph Act, from 1885. According to Mr Dalal, interception is\npossible without a Court warrant, and he does not consider the Information Technology Act from\n2000 to be a constitutionally sound law to regulate e-surveillance.\nThere is growing distrust and anger in India regarding privacy violations and violations of other civil\nliberties, and the Supreme Court has dealt with the issue several times.\nAfrica is another region characterised by incomplete of regulation. Before the development of mobile\ncommunications, only the richest city dwellers in most African nations had access to\ntelecommunication, but this picture has changed. Numerous mobile network operators and service\nproviders exist even in the poorest countries, and modern communications have become much\nmore accessible to people.\nFrost & Sullivan believes that there will be many implications for lawful interception in regions such as\nthe Middle East and Africa, not only because lawful interception regulation guarantees privacy and\ncivil liberties, but because lawful interception is also a powerful tool against corruption and similar\nevils which are often the first targets of democratisation movements.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fThe LEAs and Interception Warrants\nThe right to privacy is enshrined in many constitutions and conventions. The European Convention\non Human Rights (specifically article 8), for example, protects the individual against arbitrary\ninterference by public authorities in his or her private or family life.\nThis principle is potentially at odds with lawful interception, so, in order to protect the individual, all\nlegal frameworks define in detail what bodies can authorise interception orders and for what\npurposes.\nIn heavily regulated countries, there is complete legal and\nfunctional separation between the NWOs/SvPs/APs; the\nauthorisation of interception orders; and the LEAs.\nThe legal test for authorising an interception order (viz.\nissuing an interception warrant) varies from country to\ncountry, and not in all countries will it be a Court that\napplies that legal test. In the United Kingdom, for example,\ninterception warrants are in the hands of the Secretary of\nState, who, for domestic surveillance, is the Home Secretary\nof the day.\nHeavily\nregulated\ncountries will also\nprecisely define what\nagencies (and what\nranks of personnel in those agencies) are authorised to apply\nfor interception orders.\nThe Police will always be able to apply, but many countries\ngo further and include security services, secret intelligence\nservices, inland revenue, other authorities of the interior\nministries, border protection, customs authorities etc.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fThe Mounting Challenges of Lawful Interception\nThe requirement to assist the Police and other LEAs in their duties is not new. Call record retrieval\nin support of a subpoena is a common occurrence, and the US CALEA statute and similar laws in the\nEuropean Union and elsewhere direct network operators and service providers to provide the\ncontent of communications (CC) and related information (IRI).\nCriminal and terrorist activity of the past few years has hastened a widening in LEA powers. CALEA\nhas been updated several times to recognise broadband and VoIP services and the scope of the\nrequired interception capabilities in the EU has widened even more.\nThe trend is unmistakable: service providers will be required to support law enforcement and\nintelligence gathering with an increasing amount of data across the entire array of service offerings\nand technologies. The need to intercept traffic, occasionally store the traffic, correlate it with\nsubscriber data and quickly deliver it to an LEA will drive operational expense, causing network\noperators and service providers to reconsider their information management practices.\nIn Frost & Sullivan’s opinion, governments also need to realise that it may be in their best interest to\ntake responsibility for guaranteeing the lawful interception capabilities, rather than just piling\nrequirements on top of service providers. There is no arguing that lawful interception is an incredibly\npowerful tool in the fight against crime, and numerous potentially devastating terrorist plots have\nbeen foiled thanks to intelligence gathered via lawful interception of telecommunications.\n\nChanging Communication Patterns\nTraditionally, lawful interception was straightforward and uncomplicated because it was confined to\ncircuit-switched networks carrying voice traffic. LEAs would collect lists of numbers called and calls\nreceived by a target, and they would wire tap relevant fixed telephone lines.\nMeanwhile, the communication patterns have changed. Today’s lawbreakers have a wide range of\nsophisticated, encrypted communication channels available to them, and many of those channels rely\non resources located outside the jurisdiction of the body issuing the interception warrant. With the\nchanging communication patterns, the scope of interception has widened, presenting a real challenge\nto network operators and service providers.\nMoreover, the use of anonymous services over the Internet (e.g. hotspots and internet cafés) and\nmobile or nomadic use of telecom services across national borders make it difficult to locate and\nintercept targets.\nAddressing the Widening Interception Scope\nIn the previous chapter we saw how network operators and service providers must be able to\nintercept all applicable communications of a certain target without any gaps in coverage. Considering\nthat modern telecommunications networks offer access through a tremendous range of technologies\n(including PSTN, ISDN, xDSL, WLAN, WiMAX, GSM, GPRS, UMTS, CDMA, cable, LTE and other\nIP-based technologies), eliminating gaps in coverage is a challenge.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fMost major network operators have always pursued a dual supplier policy in order to maximise their\nbargaining power in relation to the infrastructure vendors and to avoid excessive dependence on any\none vendor. When network operators implement new communication technologies, the deal goes\nout to tender, and that often leads to the introduction of new vendors. Network operators may\neven award contracts for the expansion of existing networks to new vendors, because they are eager\nto take advantage of the aggressive pricing of emerging vendors. Consequently, most operators have\nhighly heterogeneous networks across which to maintain interception capabilities. This, in itself, is a\nformidable challenge.\nNetworks aside, an even greater challenge is the surveillance of applications. In Europe, user IDs (e.g.\nInternet logins), VoIP and e-mail are covered by the regulatory mandate. Service providers must be\nable to decrypt the communication content and supply it to the LEA in clear text if the encryption is\nprovided by the network operator or service provider, or if the provider has access to the\nencryption key.\nQuality, Speed and Capacity\nDespite the technical complexity, the network operators and service providers must deliver accurate\nand reliable content and related information.\nWhat is more, there is little time to react and strict protocol must be followed. Once they have\nreceived a warrant, operators have less than a day (typically just a few hours) to:\nVerify the warrant\nLog the warrant into an\nadministration centre\nProvision the interception\n\nActivate the interception\n\nBegin transmitting the IRI over one\nhandover interface (HI2)\n\nBegin transmitting the communication\ncontent in real time over another\nhandover interface (HI3), without\nretaining any data.\n\nAt the expiration of a warrant, the operator must immediately deactivate the interception. Naturally,\nmultiple interceptions will operate simultaneously, and everything must be concealed to the target\nand to operator staff not directly involved.\nNetwork operators and service providers that fail to meet the requirements are fined by the\nauthorities, and repeated shortfalls could even endanger their licences, as many countries write the\ninterception requirements into their licensing criteria.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fProtection and Ethics\nLawful interception is a powerful tool to fight crime, but it is an equally powerful tool to commit\ncrime, if the necessary protections are not available.\nIt would be a big mistake to assume that interception only took place in countries that have a well\ndeveloped regulatory mandate for lawful interception. In countries with no regulation, interception\ncan be used by governments to secure power by spying on its citizens, not to prevent crime but to\ncontrol behaviour. Although one could argue that network operators are not legally obligated to\ncarry out interception when there is no regulatory mandate, local operators will not find it in their\nbest interest to withstand political pressure, and the network operators are often under the effective\ncontrol of the government apparatus.\nEven in the so-called democratic world, illegal interception takes place, and it takes very little fantasy\nto imagine the damage that it can do to an individual.\nThe so-called “Greek Watergate” scandal which erupted in 2005, is one of the highest profile case of\nillegal interception in Europe. It involved 106 mobile connections on the Greek Vodafone network.\nThe victims were high-ranking civil servants and members of the Greek cabinet2. Four mobile\nswitches (MSC) used by Vodafone were compromised, and 6,500 lines of rogue software code were\ninstalled directly on the switches, allowing the illegal interception to go undetected for a year. The\nperpetrators were never found.\nThe fact that Vodafone’s lawful interception solution did not include an interception management\nsystem was one of the reasons why the malicious tap was not detected earlier.\nVodafone Greece was fined a total of €95 million by the Greek authorities.\nElsewhere in the EU, it is alleged that one third of all interceptions carried out in Bulgaria are illegal,\nand the country is currently under investigation by the European Commission3. In England, Scotland\nYard has reopened its investigation of the tabloid newspaper News of the World which has allegedly\ngained access to the voicemail messages of two private individuals.\nAlthough maintaining lawful interception capabilities represents a cost to most network operators\nand service providers, not implementing the necessary data and privacy protection measures could\nrepresent an even greater cost. In additional to hefty fines, operators that fail to meet their privacy\nchallenges leave themselves wide open to litigation which could lead to punitive damages and PR\ndisasters.\n\n\nThe Athens Affair, IEEE Spectrum Magazine, July 2007\nDnevnik, 21 January 2011\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fThe Difficult Future of Lawful Interception\nDramatic Increase in Interception Warrants\nOther than dealing with the technological complexity of interception, network operators and service\nproviders must address the challenge of the growing number of interception warrants which are\nissued.\nIn all the countries analysed by Frost & Sullivan, we recognise the same trend as illustrated by the\nTitle III Wiretap Orders (interception of CC) from the United States:\n\nSource: Administrative Office of the US Courts and Electronic Privacy Information Center, 2010\n\nIn Germany, the development is even more explosive: Between 1998 and 2007, the number of\ninterception activities grew by 308%, and the share of interceptions targeting mobile connections\ngrew from 59% to 89% exemplifying the changing communication patterns.\nFrost & Sullivan is convinced that the number of interception warrants will continue to rise. Although\nthe legislation of some countries provide relief for very small service providers, the challenge for\nnetwork operators and service providers is that they essentially have no way of knowing how many\nparallel inceptions they may be called upon to facilitate at any given time. This means that they need\nto maintain significant over capacity, in order to deal with peaks.\nThe Delicate Position of ISPs\nFrost & Sullivan believes that the future of government surveillance of its citizens will be based on the\noriginal CALEA act (and similar laws around the world) and will impact all new communications\nmediums and technologies.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fInternet-based communications have become ubiquitous and have grown far beyond the basic\ncapabilities of e-mail, and the nature of the Internet also suggests that new applications and innovative\ntools will be developed in the future to extend communication options in unpredictable ways.\nWhat is fairly certain is that the development of the regulatory mandates will follow the\ncommunication patterns; and that the ISPs will find themselves right at the heart of that development.\nIn other words, new regulatory requirements may have a bigger impact on ISPs than on network\noperators.\nIt is easy to imagine how the interception capabilities may expand to applications such as Facebook\nand Twitter; to peer-to-peer networks, chat rooms and instant messaging applications; and to lowcost voice communication through a variety of companies and emerging technologies such as VoIP\n(Voice-over-IP) and Skype.\nBecause the infrastructure on which those applications rely will typically be located outside the\njurisdiction of a single country, updates of national regulatory mandates will need to focus on the one\nelement which national legislation can control: the access. This puts the ISPs in a very delicate\nposition, because the majority of the interception obligations will fall to them.\nConsidering that many ISPs are small companies that do not have the experience and capabilities of\nthe large network operators to deal with lawful interception, the challenges are daunting.\n\nManaging the Cost of Maintaining Inception Capabilities\nIn the United States, after CALEA was passed, Congress allocated $500 million to subsidise the cost\nof implementing new interception-capable switches in the telecommunications infrastructure of the\nUS network operators. With that money spent, the network operators and service providers must\nmeet the infrastructure costs and the operational costs of maintaining the capabilities.\nIn the rest of the world, the situation varies from country to country, but the prevailing trend is that\nnetwork operations and service providers must carry the cost burden themselves.\nLawful interception is a straight cost, not associated with any revenue stream whatsoever, at any\npoint in time. The challenge is, therefore, to keep the costs as low as possible but not to accept\nshortcuts that might compromise the ability to comply with the regulatory mandate.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fUsing Technology to Address the Challenges\nMeeting the Fundamental Requirements\nAs we have seen in the previous chapters, the challenges facing network operators and service\nproviders are such that they cannot meet the fundamental requirements of lawful interception\nwithout using technology.\nRouters and switches are intelligent, and theoretically it would be possible to manually provision an\ninterception, directly at a router or switch and redirect a copy of the traffic from there. This was\nexactly what happened during the “Greek Watergate”, because the perpetrators exploited the\ninterception-capability of the switches in Vodafone’s network.\nIf operators allow interceptions to be provisioned manually at a network element, they leave\nthemselves wide open to abuse, because they are not able to perform consistency checks (i.e.\nverifying that the active interceptions exactly match the interceptions that have been warranted).\nThis again means that those operators would be in breach of the regulatory mandates of most\ncountries.\nIn reality, no real-world operator in a highly regulated country presumes to handle lawful\ninterception without some kind of dedicated solution: it is simply not possible.\n\nMonitoring Networks with Dedicated Solutions\nThere have been lawful interception solutions on the market for the better part of two decades.\nSome solutions are supplied by the network infrastructure suppliers, other solutions have been\ndeveloped by independent software vendors and system integrators. Utimaco LIMS™, the dedicated\nsolution we analyse in this whitepaper, was originally developed in the beginning of the nineties to\nhelp mobile operators fulfil their LI obligations. Since then, LIMS has continuously been extended to\nsupport additional network technologies and telecom services.\nKey Components of a Dedicated Lawful Interception Solution\nMost dedicated solutions on the market today are similar in architecture and functionality. The main\ndifference lies in the ability to interface with network elements and in the business model proposed\nby the solution vendor.\nThe figure shows the\ntypical functional flow\nof lawful interception\non\nwhich\nthe\ndedicated LI solutions\nare built.\nA monitoring centre,\nstaffed\nby\nLEA\npersonnel, relies on\nstandardised interfaces\n(e.g. ETSI or ANSI) to\ngain\naccess\nto\ncommunications provided over fixed networks, mobile networks, and IP-related channels. The monitoring interface\nhandles interception warrants, IRI and communications content separately.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fFrom the perspective of the network operator or service provider, the primary obligations and\ngeneral requirements for developing and deploying a lawful interception solution are:\n• Maintaining cost effectiveness: The solution minimises the time and effort involved in meeting\nthe interception obligations.\n• Minimising impact to the network infrastructure: The solution should not negatively\nimpact the performance or behaviour of the network.\n• Ensuring compatibility and compliance: The solution meets the requirements of national\nand international standards and is compatible with all network elements that make up the\ninfrastructure.\n• Supporting future technologies: The solution adapts to evolving standards and specifications\nas they are introduced throughout the world, and can scale to accommodate the bandwidth\nincreases and performance requirements associated with increased service levels.\n• Maintaining reliability: The solution delivers accurate results and maintains data integrity at\nevery stage of the workflow.\n• Enforcing security: At all points in the lawful interception system, data is protected against\nabuse. Surveillance activities are not detectable in any way by targets.\nActive v. passive interception\nWe can distinguish between three types of interception: Active, passive and hybrid:\nActive interception means that the interception solution is an integral part of the network\ninfrastructure. The interception management system is able to directly control the network elements\n(e.g. the routers, switches) and to filter and retrieve the IRI and CC directly at the network node.\nThe IRI and content are then sent to the interception management system, where they are mediated,\nand from there to the LEA monitoring centre.\nPassive interception means that the network elements transmit a copy of all network traffic to the\ninterception management system. The filtering takes place on the copy of the traffic within the\nmanagement system, the traffic belonging to non interception targets is discarded whereas the IRI\nand communication content of targets is passed on to the LEA monitoring centre.\nFrost & Sullivan believes active interception to be the better option of the two, due to the lower\ncapital costs and lower complexity involved. However, active interception is not an option when, for\nexample, the network elements are not interception-capable. Also, active interception can have a\nnegative impact on the performance of the network element that executes the interception function.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fHybrid Interception\nAs its name suggests, hybrid interception is a combination of active and passive interception\ntechniques, and it is becoming increasingly common. In the figure below, we illustrate hybrid\ninterception of the basis of the Utimaco LIMS™ solution.\nStraightforward circuit-switched traffic on a network with modern switches can easily be intercepted\nusing the active technique, because most telephone switches (MSCs) today support integrated\ninterception functions. Most carrier-grade routers (e.g. BRAS, CMTS) also support integrated\ninterception functions.\n\nDespite the capabilities of modern switches and routers, there are many situations where passive\nprobes are required. A good example of such a situation is the provisioning of an IP intercept. First,\nthe user login must be detected at the central AAA server of the service provider. Seeing that most\nAAA servers do not support integrated intercept features, the active technique cannot be used.\nAnother reason for using passive probes could be that access to the MSC or router is prohibited\n(because the LI system is run by another party).\nIn other words, when MSCs and routers are interception capable but the traffic that needs to be\nintercepted cannot be immediately identified (e.g. on the basis of a telephone number), then hybrid\ninterception is the best solution. On an IP network, this would mean probing for the dynamic IP\naddress of a particular target (using the passive technique); instructing the router to intercept traffic\nfrom that particular IP address (using the active technique); and relaying the traffic to the monitoring\ncentre.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fMonitoring Applications using Deep Packet Inspection\nWith the development of the communication patterns and resulting expansion of the regulatory\nmandates we discussed in the previous chapter, network operators and service providers can no\nlonger meet their obligations without using deep packet inspection technology.\nIn an IP network, the packets that pass through a network are identified by headers. The network\nrouters capture the headers, but it is not possible to identify the communication content or\napplications used by looking at the headers alone.\nDPI is a technology that can be used passively to analyse IP traffic at the application level. DPI\nequipment consists of network elements that can control entire classes of traffic on a per user or per\ngroup basis, because they are able to read below the header information as packets pass through\nthem. That is what the \"deep\" in deep packet inspection means.\nDPI can look inside all IP traffic, drill into the so-called payload (the substance) of the packets, identify\nthe applications used, pick out specific types of traffic (e.g. HTTP traffic), isolate a particular\napplication (e.g. Hotmail) and then decode application attributes and content (e.g. webmails sent and\nreceived by the user). The same principle would apply to VoIP, peer-to-peer and any other traffic\nthat would need to be intercepted. In other words, DPI can create clear-text records for various\ntypes of applications and protocols which are effectively not interceptable by the network nodes\n(routers and switches). It is also important to highlight that deep packet inspection is done in realtime (at full line rate speed).\nMany ISPs also rely on DPI for other purposes, mainly to manage congestion and give privileges to\ncertain types of traffic. Traffic shaping can be used to differentiate service levels and to create\nbroadband subscriptions that might exclude certain types of traffic (e.g. video streaming or VoIP).\nBT is a good example of an operator using DPI. According to BT4,\ndeep packet inspection enables it to better monitor its network\nand to give priority to particularly important services. BT offers a\nVoIP and IPTV service in the UK. VoIP traffic needs to move\nquickly, and IPTV must always have a certain amount of bandwidth\navailable to avoid distortions to the TV signal. BT accomplishes that\nusing DPI.\nWhen DPI is used for lawful interception purposes, additional\nfeatures are needed (e.g. the correlation of information between\nprotocol levels and the intermediate storage of connection status\ninformation) to identify and extract the relevant traffic. This is why\nmost DPI equipment that was installed for traffic shaping purposes\nis not suitable for use in an LI solution. DPI probes used in LI\nsolutions must be interception capable and be integrated into a\nlawful interception management and mediation system.\nDPI equipment can also be used to pick apart any unencrypted protocol including instant messaging,\nchat rooms, and even online gaming. Challenges still exist, however. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and\ninstant messaging are relayed through a third-party server, so the chat server is at the centre of the\nconversations. This means that the DPI equipment would only identify that Person A interacts with\nthe IRC third party server, not that Person A communicates with Person B, unless Person B is also\nan active interception target.\n\n\nArs Tecnica, 25 July 2007\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fSo, although DPI may be able to flag that some sort of suspect activity might be taking place, it is up\nto the Police to analyse the content received and to understand what is going on.\nIn Frost & Sullivan’s opinion, although no one will dispute\nthat lawful interception is a powerful tool, the real\nconcern is whether or not the Police will be able to make\nsense of data it receives.\nCommunication data is difficult to interpret outside its\noperational context, and the LEAs might not understand\nthat context. In other words, as communication patterns\nand regulatory mandates become more sophisticated,\nevery LEA that receives intercepted data will need to\nbecome more sophisticated. There is a real risk that insufficiently trained police officers will draw the wrong conclusions and, effectively, do more damage\nthan good by orientating an investigation in the wrong direction.\n\nUmbrella Systems\nWe said in the beginning that Frost & Sullivan would advise governments to take more direct\nresponsibility for maintaining lawful inception capabilities, instead of just assuming that network\noperators and service providers will be able to meet the increasingly difficult challenges.\nCertainly, many governments (e.g. in France and the UK) will pay a contribution towards the cost of\nlawful inception, but in many countries, a government-sponsored umbrella system would be an even\nbetter solution.\nAn umbrella system is an integrated lawful interception system that covers all operators in a\njurisdiction (typically a country). An umbrella system is a model by way of which the network\noperators and service providers outsource their lawful interception activities to a third party,\nsometimes known as a “Trusted Third Party” or a “Trusted Service Manager” (TSM).\nThe element of trust is important because the operators must be confident that their legal\nobligations are being met, and because all operators and providers in the eco system must trust the\nsame third party. This again means that the TSM must be once removed from the competitive\nenvironment of the country and not have stakes or other vested interests in any of the market\nplayers. Naturally, a government itself could very well be a trusted service manager.\nIn Frost & Sullivan’s opinion, umbrella systems make a lot of sense in countries with emerging\nregulation, where the individual operators have yet to build up (or upgrade) their interception\ncapabilities. Many countries in Africa and Asia could benefit from umbrella systems, accomplishing a\nlawful interception “quantum leap”.\nFrost & Sullivan also believes that umbrella systems make sense from a capital and operational cost\nperspective, because establishing and maintaining a single lawful interception system will be cheaper\nthan the combined cost of separate systems for each network operator and service provider. An\numbrella system can be used by multiple LEAs, who manage their warrants independently of each\nother. Interception activities from different LEAs are segregated, and duplicated IRI and\ncommunication content are delivered to multiple LEAs in the case of multiple activities against the\nsame target.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™, a Leading-edge Solution\nUtimaco LIMS™ is one of the most significant LI solutions available today, with more than 160\ninstallations in service with operators around the world. In this chapter, we shall analyse Utimaco\nLIMS™ as a good example of a leading-edge solution.\nUtimaco LIMS™ is a central management system for all tasks related to the lawful interception of\ntelecommunication services in mobile and fixed networks. It is a software-based solution consisting\nof the elements shown in the figure below.\n\nUtimaco LIMS runs on industry-standard servers with UNIX operating system. Customers can\nchoose between small systems with a single CPU and medium and large-rack configurations with\nmultiple CPUs and multiple servers.\nThe LIMS portfolio comprises purpose-built DPI probes (LIMS Access Points) that support real-time\nmonitoring of broadband IP networks. The probes provide wire-speed scalability from 10 Mbps to\nmultiple 10 Gbps, with the flexibility to filter IP traffic from link layer to application level. LIMS\nMediation Devices enable the integration of DPI probes and network nodes of various kinds.\nUtimaco LIMS currently supports over 250 different network elements and continues to develop\nnew mediation devices and probes (respectively new protocol plug-ins for the DPI probes) to\nrespond to emerging network technologies and upcoming lawful interception standards. Utimaco\nLIMS provides mediation in accordance with all major LI standards by ETSI, 3GPP, ANSI/ATIS, and\nCableLabs.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fMain Components of Utimaco LIMS™\nThere are five main components of the Utimaco LIMS™.\nLIMS Management Server\nThe Management Server is the core component of the LIMS system. It provides a graphical interface\nfor all users of Utimaco LIMS to administrate, operate and audit the system. Key functions of the\nLIMS Management Server are the administration of intercepts, network nodes (IAPs), authorities and\nmonitoring centres and users. The server maintains a central database to securely store all sensitive\ninformation, like target data, authority settings and audit logs.\nLIMS Mediation Device\nThe LIMS Mediation Devices perform all tasks related to the delivery of intercepted communications\nto the LEA monitoring centre. Mediation encompasses the conversion and mapping of interception\ndata received from the internal network to the appropriate formats, protocols, and interfaces as\nrequired by the LEAs. Sometimes intercepted data must be stored intermediately in the Mediation\nDevice before it can be forwarded to its final recipient. Utimaco offers the industry’s most\ncomprehensive list of mediation devices supporting a wide range of technologies, services, protocols,\nand standards. There are LIMS Mediation Devices for more than 250 different network nodes of all\nmajor vendors. The delivery of intercepted data is compliant to various national regulations and\ninternational standards including CALEA, ATIS, ETSI, and 3GPP standards.\nLIMS Access Point\nThe access points are the deep-packet-inspection probes. In passive interception, non-intrusive\nnetwork probes are integrated into the operator’s network to filter, decode, and forward\nintercepted data to the LIMS, respectively to the appropriate LIMS Mediation Device. Utimaco\nprovides a range of network probes for all common telecom protocols and network types.\nLIMS Gateway\nThe LIMS Gateway is a modular device that converts packet-switched calls to circuit-switched calls\nand vice versa. The media gateway is often needed in VoIP and next generation networks where the\nhandover interface to the LEAs requires a TDM-connection. In addition to the media conversion, the\nLIMS Gateway can also act as a signalling gateway between SS7, ISDN/DSS1, and other protocols.\nThe modular hardware concept enables customised solutions for small and large networks.\nLIMS Remote Provisioning Unit\nAll of the Management Server’s operator tasks can be accessed remotely in the same way, using the\nsame graphical user interface and functions as from the local management console. The LIMS Remote\nProvisioning Unit ensures that the same security policies apply to both remote sessions and to local\noperation.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fBenefits delivered to Network Operators and LEAs\nFlexibility and Versatility\nUtimaco LIMS™ can interface with some 250 network elements from a whole host of equipment\nsuppliers. It has more interfaces than any other LI solution on the market today. Network operators\nare able to expand their networks and implement best-of-breed technology, without worrying about\nadverse effects on their LI capabilities.\nOwing to its modular software and hardware architecture Utimaco LIMS can be modified to support\nupcoming network technologies and services. The system scales from small networks with only few\nintercept targets to large networks with tens of thousands of simultaneous targets.\nLow OPEX and CAPEX\nUtimaco LIMS reduces the operational costs of providing lawful interception services to LEAs by\nautomating the interception processes and by using centralised administration.\nCapital expenditure is minimised by using one single management system for many different\nnetworks and services. One LIMS can serve multiple tenants to support managed service models and\nMVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operator).\nCertified Compliance\nUtimaco LIMS has been tested for compliance with all common international LI standards from ETSI,\n3GPP, ANSI/ATIS, and CableLabs. LIMS has been installed and certified in more than 60 countries\nworldwide. Utimaco has never failed to bid for a lawful interception deal due to an inability to\ncomply with international or local standards.\nShort Time-to-Market\nUtimaco has been developing lawful interception solutions for more than 16 years. The LIMS system\nhas been integrated and tested with network nodes of all leading telecom and Internet infrastructure\nvendors. For operators this means shortest implementation times at minimum costs.\nHigh Security Standards\nHaving been a leading IT security company for 25 years, Utimaco has implemented highest security\nstandards throughout the LIMS system. This prevents misuse and provides the legal certainty to\nnetwork operators and service providers that they can live up to their LI obligations without\nbreaching their privacy protection obligations.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fConclusion\nThe need for surveillance to combat crime and terrorism has never been greater than it is today, and\nthe terrorists and other criminals have become extremely sophisticated in their use of today’s\ncommunications technologies. For the police and intelligence agencies, this creates an urgent need to\nmonitor and collect data from sources other than traditional circuit-switched voice traffic.\nThe regulatory mandates have expanded to interception capabilities for traffic that scarcely existed\ntwenty years ago. No one is arguing that lawful interception is not a powerful law enforcement tool,\nbut it does impose a huge burden on network operators and service providers. In this whitepaper we\nhave shown that operator challenges are mounting and that many network operators and service\nproviders will be struggling to meet their obligations.\nIn Frost & Sullivan’s opinion, there is hardly an alternative to deploying a dedicated, complete LI\nsolution. Without a complete solution, compliance can be a lot of work and there is an inherent risk\nof abuse and other failures to protect the privacy of the users. As we saw in the Greek scandal, it\nwas the absence of an interception management system that made the illegal interception possible.\nThere are many valid lawful interception solutions on the market. To realise the greatest benefits\nfrom the investment, Frost & Sullivan recommends that network operators and service providers\nshould also implement best practice (i.e. overhaul procedures and streamline LI operations) to keep\nthe operational costs down. The best way to introduce best practice is to partner with an LI vendor\nwith many years of experience of designing and implementing LI solutions.\nLarge network operators are likely to have highly heterogeneous networks. They are also likely to\nhave several legacy LI systems in place, typically controlling different network elements supplied by\ndifferent infrastructure vendors. Because most operators accrue no revenue from lawful\ninterception, continuous stop-gap upgrades to the various legacy solutions at an incremental cost\nmay seem like the obvious choice, but it may be the entirely wrong policy to pursue.\nIn the long run, and although the initial investment would be higher, Frost & Sullivan believes\noperators should consider migrating to a single, future-proof lawful interception platform.\nFrost & Sullivan has analysed Utimaco’s LIMS™ solution, and we are satisfied that it is one of the\nmost complete and versatile solutions on the market today. We are confident that migrating to a\nsingle Utimaco LIMS™ platform or introducing a Utimaco LIMS™ solution for the first time would\nenable most network operators and service providers to meet their lawful interception challenges,\nnow and in the future.\nUtimaco LIMS™ is not unique in the marketplace, but Frost & Sullivan’s believes that its strategy to\nfocus on interfacing with as many network elements as possible and supporting all international and\nlocal standards does give it a competitive advantage. The decision to design Utimaco LIMS™ around\ncommercial, off-the-shelf hardware adds to the flexibility of the solution and keeps the incidental IT\ncosts down.\nNetwork operators and service providers looking to select a lawful interception vendor should\nconsider the long-term implications of the investment. They will need regular updates and support,\nand they will need to adapt to future requirements, so it is important to partner with a vendor to\nwhom lawful interception is fundamental part of the product offering and who is likely to be around\nin the long run. Frost & Sullivan believes that Utimaco is one such vendor.\n\nLawful Interception: A Mounting Challenge for Service Providers and Governments\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2011\n\n\n\fC ON TAC T\nUS\n\nLondon\n4 Grosvenor Gardens\nLondon SW1W 0DH\nTel. +44 (0)20 7343 8383\nFax +44 (0)20 7730 3343\nOxford\nOxford Business Park South\nOxford OX4 2GX\nTel. +44 (0)1865 39 8600\nFax +44 (0)1865 39 8601\nFrankfurt\nClemensstraße 9\n60487 Frankfurt a.M.\nTel. +49 (0)69 7 70 33-0\nFax +49 (0)69 23 45 66\nParis\n24, rue de Londres\n75009 Paris\nTel. +33 (0)1 42 81 54 50\nFax +33 (0)1 42 81 54 52\n\nBeijing\nBengaluru\nBogotá\n\nMilan\nVia Mario Pagano, 38\n20145 Milano\nTel. +39 02 4651 4819\nFax +39 02 4802 7054\n\nBuenos Aires\nCape Town\nChennai\nDelhi\nDubai\nFrankfurt\nKolkata\nKuala Lumpur\nLondon\nMelbourne\n\nAbout Utimaco\nFor more than 25 years Utimaco has been a leading global provider of\ndata security solutions.

As such, the Directive affects all providers of electronic communication services (e.g. fixed,\nmobile and cable operators; Internet Service Providers; VoIP providers; and satellite operators).\nAlthough the Directive harmonises the data retention obligations, it has not been implemented in a\nuniform way by all EU members, meaning that the playing field for communication providers is not\nlevel across Europe. Some EU countries reimburse the costs associated with data retention, others\nprovide subsidies based on transactions, and other countries again provide no funding at all.\nThere are EU countries that have yet to implement the Directive and countries in which the national\nimplementation of the Directive has been declared unconstitutional. Also, the Directive only covers\nthe retention of records that communication has taken place, not the contents of the\ncommunication: Telephone and web tapping remain controlled by national regulations.\nEUDRD Implementation Status\nEUDRD fully implemented\nEUDRD implemented in 2010\nNon EU member\nEUDRD transposed into law\nbut declared unconstitutional\nEUDRD not implemented\n\nCorrect: June, 2010\nSource: Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\nSweden is one of the countries that have not yet implemented the EUDRD. The Swedish justice\nminister has publicly stated that she does not much like the Directive, and several Swedish politicians\nwant to challenge the Directive in court, alleging that it might contravene the European Convention\non Human Rights.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fThere is still much debate across Europe over the right to privacy and the risk of abuse of data\nretained centrally. At the same time, citizen expectations on the ability of police to prevent and\nrapidly solve serious crime are increasing, while funding for police and security service activities is\nunder pressure due to budgetary constraints.\nWhat this means to telecom operators and other communication providers is that data retention is a\ndynamic area – despite the EUDRD – and that it can be difficult to accurately forecast the magnitude\nand nature of future obligations.\nWith the general increase in legislation brought in to fight terrorism and other crime, Frost & Sullivan\nbelieves that data retention obligations will multiply over time and that the burden placed on\ncommunication providers will become heavier than it is today.\nBecause the EUDRD is the most extensive piece of data retention legislation adopted by any country\nor union of countries today, Frost & Sullivan believes that emerging regulations in other parts of the\nworld will be similar. For this reason, we believe the EUDRD to be highly relevant even to\ncommunication providers outside Europe.\n\nCommunication Providers must retain up to 15 Data Categories\nAs the rules stand today, communication providers must capture and retain data in a long list of\ncategories.\nCategories of data to be retained, by service type\nFixed Telephony\n\nMobile Telephony\n\nInternet Access, E-mail\n\n• Calling and called\nnumbers\n\n• Calling and called\nnumbers\n\n• User ID of the sender and\nthe recipient\n\n• Numbers forwarded to\n\n• Numbers forwarded to\n\n• Name and address of user\n\n• Name and address of user\n\n• Name and address of user\n\n• Date/time of start and\nend of call\n\n• Date/time of start and\nend of call\n\n• IP addresses allocated to\nsender and recipient\n\n• Telephone services used\n\n• Telephone services used\n• Calling and called parties’\nIMSI\n• Calling and called parties’\nIMEI\n• Cell ID of initial activation\nfor prepaid\n\n• Date/time of log-in and\nlog-off\n• Internet services used\n• Calling number for dial-up\naccess\n• DSL or endpoint for\nbroadband services\n\n• Cell IDs throughout call\nOther than defining the 15 categories of data to be retained, the Directive places three additional\nobligations on communication providers.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fThe Data Retention Periods Vary\nThe EUDRD defines that communication providers must retain data for a minimum of 6 months and\na maximum of two years from the day the communication took place. It is up to the individual EU\ncountries whether to mandate shorter or longer retention periods.\nMost EU countries have implemented a retention period of 12 months. Under special circumstances,\nthe Member States may extend the retention period beyond two years. To communication\nproviders, this means that the future storage requirements can be unpredictable.\n\nData Retention is Time Critical\nWhen the police (or security services) present a request, communication providers must make the\nrelevant data available without “undue delay”. Data requested for terrorism prevention purposes is\nmore time-critical than anything else, and a delay of just a few hours could have severe\nconsequences.\nCommunication providers are likely to have the required data dispersed across their networks,\nmeaning that a single police warrant can involve several systems and departments. Also,\ncommunication providers must make sure that only data covered by the warrant is passed on to the\npolice.\n\nData Security is Paramount\nCommunication providers must ensure the completeness and integrity of the data they retain. This\nmeans that they must have a procedure in place to track all relevant categories of data and to\ncapture all data points within those categories.\nAlso, communication providers must protect the data against accidental or intentional destruction;\naccidental loss or alteration; unauthorised or unlawful storage; processing, access, disclosure or\naccession by unauthorised persons.\nFinally, at the end of the retention period, the communication provider is obliged to destroy the\nretained data.\n\nCommunication Provider Challenges and their Evolution\nThe EUDRD was written to serve police\nneeds and to guarantee data security.\nWhat the Directive does not consider is\nthe heterogeneous nature of the\nnetworks and systems of most\ncommunication providers.\nThis is why meeting their obligations\nunder the EUDRD can create formidable\ntechnical, financial and planning challenges\n– challenges which will grow over time.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fData Completeness and Integrity\nVoice call detail records (CDRs) on a traditional TDM network are straightforward to collect and\nmake available. For the most part, this data comes from a single type of network node (typically a\nswitch or a CDR mediation platform) and must simply be mapped to the user. For mobile operators\nthe situation is more complex. There are many sources of CDRs, due to the different services (e.g.\npostpaid calls, prepaid calls, SMS, MMS, mobile data, roaming calls, etc.).\nOften. CDRs relating to unsuccessful call attempts and incoming calls are not stored, because that\ntype of traffic is typically not billable. The EUDRD does, however, require that such CDRs should be\nretained, if they are generated by the network\nAn IP session record is even more\ncomplicated. It includes information from\nmultiple network servers and databases.\nCommunication providers need to retain IP\nrecords due to the requirement to capture\nboth e-mail traffic and internet access, and the\nnetworks were not designed to do this.\nThe rising amount of VoIP traffic that is not\nbilled on a per call basis aggravates the\nproblem for communication providers. The\ncontinuous evolution of networking technologies towards IP will further add to their\nwoes.\nSome network owners do not have a direct\nrelationship with the end user, and this adds a\nfurther level of complication. Many mobile\nnetwork operators host several MVNOs on their network, and a similar situation exists in the\nInternet access space. Network operators must segregate data related to different MVNOs and ISPs\nas well as data related to their own end users.\nWhat all this means is that existing CDR-based systems are not capable of supporting the full scope\nof the EUDRD without major upgrades, meaning that communication providers will need to deal\nwith missing data (e.g. location information with all services, Internet logs, e-mail logs, incoming calls\netc.).\n\nNumber of Records\nThe sheer number of detail records is a challenge. Frost & Sullivan estimates that a large\ncommunication provider could have in excess of a billion records to capture and process every single\nday. Although each record is not more than 300-400 bytes on average, there must be a proper\nsystem in place to mediate, load and store the data efficiently.\nThe development of the communications market with more and more services coming online that\nwill require data to be retained will result in the already large number of records to increase further.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fData Centre Demands Spiralling\nThere is hardly an organisation in the world not concerned about the capacity of its data centre(s). In\nrecent years, the development of data loads (i.e. the computational loads of data to be processed)\nand the related storage requirements has been truly exceptional. Not only has the increase in data\nloads been enormous, it also appears that the rate at which data loads increase every year is not\nslowing down.\nMany data centres are already struggling to cope with demand, and research conducted by Frost &\nSullivan has shown that two thirds of organisations believe they will run out of data centre capacity\nwithin the next two years – if they have not run out already.\nOnce stored, a communication provider’s data\ncentre must protect the records in order to live\nup to the stringent data security requirements of\nthe EUDRD. This, in itself, requires a rethink,\nbecause most data centres were not set up with\nthe EUDRD in mind, and because security\nmeasures have detailed implications all the way\ndown to the physical location of the data centre.\nIn short, the EUDRD adversely affects an already\ndifficult situation for many communication\nprovider data centres. As the number of retained\nrecords grows, the storage requirement will grow.\nMost organisations are acutely aware of this, but\nthey do not always have a solution readily\navailable.\n\nFinancial Challenges\nThe EUDRD creates both direct and indirect financial challenges for communication providers. The\ndirect financial challenges relate to the cost of implementing and maintaining a data retention system\nand to the handling of the individual requests for data to be made available to the police.\nSome countries subsidise the direct data retention costs, but subsidies are neither fully transparent,\nnor consistent across the EU countries, and some countries provide no subsidies whatsoever.\nFrost & Sullivan regards the United Kingdom as a best practice example. The UK operates a\nreimbursement scheme which covers the capital expenditure of systems and operating expenditure\nof staff, with a budget of approximately £30 million per year (≈€36 million).\nEven so, Frost & Sullivan estimates that the average yearly cost of living up to the obligations of the\nEUDRD could run as high as €0.10 per subscriber (or prepaid user). The costs are particularly high\nfor operators that have frequent interaction with the police and security services, and we find the\nmain cost driver to be the high level of manual processes on which many operators still rely, tying up\nskilled resources to ensure timely EUDRD compliance.\nWhat this means to communication providers is that, even if they receive a government subsidy\ntowards meeting the EUDRD obligations, they need to be looking at minimising operational costs by\nimproving their automated response capabilities.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fFinally, no governments pay any subsidies or compensation for indirect data retention costs, and\nFrost & Sullivan finds that many operators fail to even capture these costs and recognise them as\nEUDRD compliance costs.\nIndirect costs have different root causes. They can be upgrade costs at a data centre or even real\nestate costs at a data centre that outgrows its existing facilities. Indirect costs can also be the cost of\ndisruption to business flows and processes, as existing systems are modified to cope with data\nretention, or it could be the opportunity cost of staff whose time is channelled from revenuegenerating activities (e.g. the provisioning of end-user billable services) to EUDRD activities which\nare not revenue generating.\nA relatively modest investment in more sophisticated data retention systems and procedures could\ncreate significant savings elsewhere in the organisation.\n\nLack of Standardisation\nEven though ETSI has defined an electronic handover interface – the RDHI – which would\nstandardise the way the police and security services send warrants and receive results, the handover\ninterface has not yet been implemented.\nThis means that communication providers must be prepared to receive warrants in many different\nforms: Faxes, e-mails or even traditional letters. It also means that the processing of a single warrant\ncan involve a lot of purely manual work. This obviously generates an unnecessary cost – as we\ndiscussed in the previous chapter – but it also creates organisational challenge because there is no\neasy way to measure performance and to facilitate easy follow-up.\nCommunication providers also need to live up to their\ndata protection obligations under the EUDRD,\nmeaning that they must exercise due care when\ntransmitting retained data to the police and in making\nsure that only records covered by a warrant are\nactually transmitted. Moreover, it is not in all cases\neasy for communication provider staff to establish\nwhether or not a police request for data is valid and\njustified.\nUnfortunately, Frost & Sullivan does not believe that\nthe RDHI will be made mandatory any time soon. In\nmany European countries, the responsibility for\npolicing is fragmented, and numerous police and\nsecurity services exist (some of them even working in\nparallel with similar remits) so streamlining the police\nside of things could be tricky.\nIn all fairness, the national regulators in some\ncountries have strong ambitions to establish the RDHI\nas a standard, and these ambitions obviously enjoy the\nsupport of the communication providers. In Germany,\nfor example, the TKÜV regulation already specifies\nthe RDHI as an optional interface.\nThat said, the RDHI will only be a truly effective tool if it is exclusive, meaning that communication\nproviders would be allowed to reject warrants transmitted through any other means. Given the\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\frelative lack of IT sophistication of many European police forces, the European ministries of the\ninterior are not likely to throw their weight behind the RDHI, just to help the communication\nproviders.\nAn even greater standardisation challenge relates to cross-border data flows, particularly for panregional operators, as varying national legislation does not adhere to EU’s freedom of transfer of\ninformation.\n\nPolitical Challenges\nBecause most EU directives need to be transposed into national legislation (in most cases) before\nthey become a source of law, the EU data retention regulations are open to national differences in\nimplementation and interpretation. This creates a political challenge for communication providers,\nbecause they cannot be certain that their data retention obligations will not change, even if the\nDirective remains the same, due to national political intervention.\nAt the moment, response times and standards\nare effectively different across the different\nlevels of service providers in Europe, and there\nare even inconsistencies between similar\noperators in the same countries. In most\ncountries, parliament will have voted to\nauthorise a minister (e.g. the minister of the\ninterior, the justice minister or the minister of\ncommunication) to specify the detailed\ninterpretation of the law. There is nothing\nstopping a minister from issuing a strict\nregulation if he or she feels communication\nprovider performance to be sub optimal. If there\nwere ever a case in which it could be alleged\nthat a serious crime had not been prevented\ndue to slow response times, ministers would\nmost certainly leap to tighten regulation.\nFinally, growth of different types of new\ncommunication technologies, not covered in the\ncurrent Directive, could result in extended data\nretention obligations to cover the new means of communication, leading to further challenges for\ncommunication providers.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fDifferent Solutions to Meeting the Challenges\nWe have established that the vast majority of communication providers will not be able to meet the\nchallenges of the EUDRD unless they take concrete measures. They can adapt existing systems;\ninvest in a new, dedicated system; or outsource data retention altogether.\n\nAdapting Existing Systems\nAdapting existing systems may be a good option for smaller telecom operators with a limited service\noffering.\nAll operators already have operations and billing support systems (OSS/BSS) in place, and most\noperators own those systems and operate them in house. Small MVNOs may outsource OSS/BSS to\na third party (typically the network operator or enabler).\nExisting OSS/BSS solutions include sub systems that pull data off the network nodes and generate\nCDRs; sub systems that calculate the cost of the call (a function referred to as “rating” or “charging”)\nand sub systems that issue a bill for the call. These sub systems will map CDRs to individual users.\nMost operators will also have fraud prevention and detection systems in place (some referred to as\n“revenue assurance”) which track usage by individual post and prepaid subscribers and makes sure\nthat a user does not run up unduly high bills or is allowed to continue calls after he or she has\ndepleted a prepaid credit.\nAll the solutions and sub systems can potentially be adapted to provide EUDRD compliance. In the\nshort term, adapting existing systems can be a cheap solution which avoids large capital outlays.\nThere are, however, a number of important caveats.\nAll the solutions and sub systems we have described have the one thing in common that they were\ndesigned to handle chargeable calls (or chargeable internet access). Consequently, they are not well\nsuited to capturing traffic for which an operator does not charge on a per call basis or per megabyte\nbasis (e.g. e-mail, flatrated broadband access, unsuccessful call attempts, incoming calls etc.).\nThe adaptation of existing systems are in-house projects, and operators need to manage the\ndevelopment process and the lifecycle of the new solution. This is not cheap, and the cost of\nintegration may not be correctly captured in organisations. With in-house projects, there is a\ntendency to just deal with the immediate issues and not consider future requirements, meaning that\nan adapted existing system might not be a future-proof solution.\nWhen operators implement upgrades and other developments to existing systems, there is always a\nrisk of disruption. The billing function is at the heart of every operator. Even short disruptions –\nwhen operators are unable to process bills for just a few days – will have an immediate and adverse\neffect on cash flow.\n\nImplementing Dedicated Solutions\nAn alternative to interfering with existing systems is the implementation of a dedicated data\nretention solution.\nThere are a number of dedicated data retention solutions on the market that were conceived for\ndata retention and store data separately. The vendors of dedicated solutions vary in their background\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\f(there are specialised vendors, storage vendors, telecom equipment vendors, security vendors and\nsystem integrators); in their business models and go-to-market strategies.\nOver the past few years, Frost & Sullivan has seen the market for dedicated solutions grow. Clearly,\nmany communication providers have felt encouraged to invest in more sophisticated data retention\nsolutions. Many of these communication providers share the expectation that their data retention\nobligations will grow in the future, due to increasing concerns in society over criminal activity and\nterrorism.\nDespite the initial investment, for most communication providers, Frost & Sullivan believes that\ndedicated systems will be the cheaper option in the medium to long term. Also, in countries where\nthe data protection regulation allows data mining for commercial purposes, a dedicated solution will\ngive communication providers a better, more complete picture of usage patterns, allowing them to\ncarry out complex analyses for business development and planning purposes.\nIn this whitepaper, we will analyse one good example of a dedicated data retention solution – the\nUtimaco DRS™.\nHeadquartered in Germany, Sophos-owned Utimaco Safeware AG has addressed the challenges of\nthe EUDRD with the introduction of an all new, purpose-built solution for telecom data retention.\nThe Utimaco DRS™ is based on the experience and technology of Utimaco’s world-leading lawful\nintercept system, the Utimaco LIMS™, deployed by telecom operators in more than sixty countries\naround the world.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™ is a Valid Data Retention Solution\nUtimaco DRS™ (“DRS” stands for Data Retention Suite) is built around one front-end component –\nthe DRS Management Server – and two back-end components – the DRS Backend Server and Data\nWarehouse, as illustrated below.\n\nSource: Utimaco Safeware AG, 2010\n\nUtimaco DRS™ was designed for seamless integration into existing multi-vendor and multi-service\nnetworks. The solution can be customised easily to interface with CDR/IPDR systems, log files, subscriber databases, and other network nodes.\n\nData Warehousing Solution\nIn one of the previous chapters of this whitepaper we have seen why storage is such a fundamental\npart of any data retention system, so we will examine the storage component of Utimaco DRS™ in\nsome detail.\nThree approaches to storage exist:\n•\n•\n•\n\nData Warehousing\nTiered Storage\nRelational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\nThe storage component of Utimaco DRS™ is a data warehousing solution. The advantage of the data\nwarehouse is that it can handle huge volumes of data without reducing the accessibility of the data\nbut is generally not the cheapest solution. Tiered storage, on the other hand, archives older data in\nmoderate to low performance databases, thereby reducing the cost of storage. The disadvantage is\nthat the accessibility of the data is reduced. RDBMS provides fast and precise retrieval but is not well\nsuited for billions of small records like CDRs/IPDRs, as they generate too much overhead and\nprovide poor query times. RDBMS are designed for transaction, not for fast queries and analytics.\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fFrost & Sullivan finds that Utimaco has taken an innovative approach to data warehousing, aiming to\nprovide the best of both worlds – swift data handling and low cost. The organisation of the data in\nthe DRS data warehouse differs significantly from common relational databases. DRS arranges the\ndata by column rather than by line, automatically indexing tables but avoiding the overhead\nassociated with traditional approaches to indexing.\nColumnar storage also means that much more effective compression algorithms can be applied to\nthe data so that storage requirements are reduced even further. Compression rates between 40%\nand 80% are common for CDR data.\n\nMulti-tenant Solution\nA single Utimaco DRS™ system can be used to administer warrants and search requests for multiple\nnetwork operators and service providers.\nThe granular rights management system of Utimaco DRS™ can be configured to securely segregate\nbetween networks, users, and authorities and thus supports various business models like MVNO\nmodels, managed services, or cross-border service platforms.\n\nConfigurable Workflow\nUtimaco DRS™ incorporates a configurable workflow management system which reduces\noperational expenses by automating the administrative tasks of request handling and delivery of\nsearch results to authorized agencies.\nComprehensive security mechanisms like granular user management functionality, strong access\ncontrol, encrypted storage and handover, and full audit trails of all user and system events, are\nfundamental features to fulfil the EUDRD obligations without compromising compliance with national\ndata protection laws.\n\nCost Advantage\nAccording to Utimaco, the average yearly cost of complying with the EUDRD using Utimaco DRS™\ncould be as little as €0.01 per subscriber – or ten times lower than the costs currently incurred by\nsome communication providers.\nIf one compares to the alternative of adapting existing OSS/BSS solutions to cope with data retention\nrequirements, Frost & Sullivan is satisfied that Utimaco DRS™ will provide lower overall data\nretention costs, better response times for handling warrants as well as less complicated workflows\nand internal procedures.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fBeyond the European Union\nBecause the EUDRD is the most extensive piece of data retention legislation adopted by any country\nor union of countries today, Frost & Sullivan believes that emerging regulations in other parts of the\nworld will be similar.\nThe issue of data retention is critical for homeland security regardless of what county enacts such\nregulations, yet the methods and solutions needed to satisfy these requirements must account for\nthe importance of subscriber information and avoid violating the privacy of individuals who are not\nsubjects of criminal investigations. This need was anticipated by the EUDRD and will likely be a part\nof other legislation throughout the world.\n\nEEA and Australasia\nThe EEA allows participation in the EU Single Market by non EU members, on condition that the non\nEU members adhere to a significant portion of the EU regulatory framework. The EEA has taken a\ntough stand on money laundering and bank secrecy, and data retention would logically be covered by\nthe agreement. The EEA has, however, postponed the implementation of data retention provisions\nuntil a joint committee has reached political agreement on the inclusion of the EUDRD into the EEA\nframework.\nThe global need for police and security service authorised data retention is gaining significance worldwide and will be a major concern for many countries in the coming years due to security threats\nfrom current global events. Frost & Sullivan is seeing data retention needs outside Europe and North\nAmerica come into focus. Countries such as New Zealand and Australia as well as some of the\nnations in Southeast Asia have or are now considering data retention legislation.\n\nUnited States\nAlthough the Obama administration has yet to state its position with regard to enacting a data\nretention law, Frost & Sullivan believes that enhanced data retention directives will likely be drafted\nfor legislation in the\nUnited States, as soon as\nthe presidency has dealt\nwith some of the more\npressing\neconomic\nagendas.\nSince 9/11 there has been\na shift in the perception of\nthe American public of the\nbalance between civil\nliberties and effective\ncrime prevention. Because\ndata retention is such a\npowerful tool which is relatively inexpensive (for the law enforcement agencies) to implement, we\nthink that data retention legislation, if it comes, will be far less controversial today than it would have\nbeen ten years ago.\nCurrent US laws define a data preservation obligation, not data retention. Data preservation only\nrequires communication providers to retain specific information explicitly requested by the law\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fenforcement agencies. This, of course, is very different from the concept of data retention, as defined\nby the EUDRD.\nOver the last couple of years, legislation has been proposed in the US that would require companies\nto hold on to data for specific time periods without the requirement of a government request. Such\nlegislation would mirror the EU’s data retention directive. Many spectators believe that any proposed\nlegislation would, in first instance, apply to ISPs and require retention for a period to be determined\nby the Attorney General.\nThe US has an even more fragmented approach to policing than countries like the United Kingdom\nand Italy, and this is certainly a challenge for law-makers. We can, perhaps, assume that the US will\nhave learnt important lessons from Europe and will have addressed issues such as the standardisation\nof the interface between law enforcement agencies and communication providers.\nCurrently, it is common practise amongst operators and ISPs to store communications data for all\nkinds of other purposes (billing, fraud prevention, data mining etc.). US law does not require\noperators and ISPs to destroy this data within a certain time period, so it is fair to say that the\ncurrent US system lacks important regulations and restrictions in regards to data privacy. A\nsubpoena is sufficient for law enforcement agencies to request potentially sensitive personal data. If\nthe US introduces data retention, it will have to also address the existing privacy deficit by mandating\nthat data be destroyed after a certain period, and this will significantly add to the complexity of\ncommunication provider operations.\nFrost & Sullivan believes that a solution like the Utimaco DRS™ will become a necessary tool for US\ncommunication providers to deal with future data retention requirements.\n\nBeyond Telecommunications\nFrost & Sullivan expects that future developments of the EUDRD will span across other sectors. An\nextended scope of the EUDRD – or new directives that might replace it – could cover sectors such\nas airlines, train operators, banks, insurance companies, retail, entertainment and the healthcare\nsector.\nIn some countries, there are national initiatives to that effect, some driven by the trend towards egovernment and e-healthcare, and a desire to deliver services to citizens more efficiently to offset the\neffects of budget cuts. Frost & Sullivan is already seeing a beginning customisation of dedicated data\nretention solutions to meet the requirements from other sectors.\nFrost & Sullivan believes that, over time, as more complex customer service offerings become\nprevalent by providing a real-time component based on presence, location and/or preference, the\nneed for retaining and correlating data, not only to address police and security services but also to\naddress other business needs on a near real-time basis, will be the norm rather than the exception.\nWe also believe that data retention can become a revenue stream for some communication\nproviders. As data retention obligations are introduced in other sectors, market players will be\nlooking at outsourcing, opening up a market for third-party data retention service providers.\nTelecom operators and ISPs, having amassed unrivalled experience in this field and having already\ninvested in sophisticated data retention solutions, will be in a good position to exploit this\nopportunity.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fConclusion\nWe have shown that the far-reaching provisions of the EU Data Retention Directive create significant\nchallenges for communication providers throughout Europe.\nCommunication providers trying to decide what steps to take to address these challenges should\nthink very carefully about whether to adapt existing systems or invest in a dedicated solution, and\nthey should consider the long-term implications.\nWhereas adapting existing OSS/BSS solutions is a viable option for smaller telecom operators with\nsimple service offerings, Frost & Sullivan believes that the majority of communication providers\nwould benefit from the implementation of a dedicated data retention solution.\nGiven the diversity of solutions in the market, communication providers should ensure an exhaustive\nfeasibility analysis of the varying capabilities of each solution, particularly in terms of scalability and\nthe viability of upgrades in meeting future requirements. Selecting a future-proof solution is\nparticularly important, as the increase in the amount of legislation concerning terrorism and crime, is\nlikely to lead to more and stricter data retention regulation.\nFrost & Sullivan has analysed the Utimaco DRS™ and concludes that this is a valid solution which will\nenable communication providers to effectively meet the challenges of data retention. We are satisfied\nthat Utimaco DRS™ will provide cost savings in the medium term; improve workflows and\nprocedures; that it will integrate with legacy systems and networks; and that it will handle vast\nquantities of data and provide fast response times.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Data Retention: Now and in the Future\n© Frost & Sullivan, 2010\n\n\n\fC ON TAC T\nUS\n\nLondon\n4 Grosvenor Gardens\nLondon SW1W 0DH\nTel. +44 (0)20 7343 8383\nFax +44 (0)20 7730 3343\nOxford\nOxford Business Park South\nOxford OX4 2GX\nTel. +44 (0)1865 39 8600\nFax +44 (0)1865 39 8601\nFrankfurt\nClemensstraße 9\n60487 Frankfurt a.M.\nTel. +49 (0)69 7 70 33-0\nFax +49 (0)69 23 45 66\nParis\n24, rue de Londres\n75009 Paris\nTel. +33 (0)1 42 81 54 50\nFax +33 (0)1 42 81 54 52\n\nBeijing\nBengaluru\nBogotá\n\nMilan\nVia Mario Pagano, 38\n20145 Milano\nTel. +39 02 4651 4819\nFax +39 02 4802 7054\n\nBuenos Aires\nCape Town\nChennai\nDelhi\nDubai\nFrankfurt\nKolkata\nKuala Lumpur\nLondon\nMelbourne\n\nAbout Utimaco\nFor more than 25 years Utimaco has been a leading global provider of\ndata security solutions.

So the\npressure is on to find new science to meet cyber-intelligence\nneeds.\n\"As optical and cloud computing are introduced, all of a\nsudden there is a new [flexibility to] where processing can be\ndone,\" says Lt. Gen. William Lord, the U.S. Air Force's chief\ninformation officer. \"It changes the way you go after a problem, certainly. I don't see the way people look for, move and\ndissect the information changing for a long while. But we will\nhave to do it faster.\n\"What that [desire for additional speed] drives is the need\nto do [more intelligence analysis and cyber forensics] in the\nsame place even if the people involved are from different organizations,\" Lord says. \"All of a sudden, it's not so much about\norganization a s it is about where [experts, analysts and specialists] come together.. . . Maybe it's even virtual teams that\nare tied together with social network sites.\"\nSo a major breakthrough in tapping into messages sent via\nhigh-volume fiber optics will be discovering how to use optics\nto manage light. One company-Glimmerglass-believes\nit\nhas an answer to some of cyberspace's acceleration problems.\nCompany researchers use three-dimensional micro-electro-\n\nmechanical systems (3D MEMS) technology, patented algorithm controls and tiny mirrors-that relay hundreds of light\nstreams-to sort and distribute light-borne communication\nsignals.\nA small, 1.5 X 3 X 3-in. switching engine, for example, manages optical signal paths between 192 inputloutput, high-density optical fibers, eliminating the need for about 190 electrical\nconversions. The signals are monitored by photo detectors as\nthey come into the switch. These, in turn, are directed onto a\n3D MEMS array embedded with hundreds of l-mm.-wide micro-mirrors.\n\"This very exotic lens array can be focused so each beam is\npointed toward a different mirror,\" says Glimmerglass President/CEO Robert Lundy. \"The MEMS micro-mirror array is\n[etched into] single-crystal silicon. Each mirror is covered in a\ngold overlay, is deep-well etched, frictionless and floats on four\n3-micron metallic springs. Mirrors can be moved as much as\n4.6 deg. to point at a bounce mirror that can direct its beam to\nany other mirror on the same array. In addition, they can all\n'talk' to each other.\"\nThere are also requirements to capture ultra-low levels of\nlight pulled from optical signals.\n\"For example, we have been selling to one of the major\n[aerospace industry] integrators for four years,\" Lundy reveals.\" It started during meetings with one of the international\nagencies. They asked us how to manage -40dBm light [a tiny\npower measurement]. That's like a photon per fortnight-an\nalmost impossible perception of an optical signal. It is some\nthousandths of the original signal. We showed that we could\nmonitor, connect and switch it. Most of [our] 17 patents are\nassociated with the array design, the MEMS design and the\ncontrol system,\" Lundy says.\nThe device passes incoming beams through an array of\noptical lenses that focus them onto a corresponding array of\n\n\f210 l-mm.-wide articulating mirrors. The mirrors, managed\nremotely through software, then bounce the beams to selected\noutput fibers to be distributed to processing locations and\nanalysts. Signals also can be optically split into multiple perfect copies and each copy connected to a separate output for\neven wider distribution.\nVarying the voltage of three electro-static probes underneath each mirror produces the proper tilt. The ceramic\nsubstrate, lens array and housing are thermally matched to\nreduce stress during temperature variations.\n\"The magic is in keeping the temperature stable and the\nmean time between failures high,\" Lundy says. \"Right now,\nit's about 16 years!'\nA feedback loop starts from the device's output. The optical\nsignal goes through a photo-detector that keeps track of the\npower level, which is monitored by software. The mirrors are\ndynamic-always in motion-so the control system compensates for the resulting thermal changes or shock.\n\"We are just now starting to look on the other side of the\n[intelligence] veil to find out what they really need,\" Lundy\nsays. We're the optical signal management system that allows\nthe agencies to create, monitor and reconfigure light paths\nvery dynamically.\"\nAnalysts are expressing relief at having equipment that\neliminates a lot of manual activity.\n\n\"So if the equipment was located in a little room halfway\naround the world,\" says Keith May, Glimmerglass's director\nof business development, \"they would text a guy, ask him to\nmove cable A into slot B. That's how they did business before.\nNow they can sit [in a location near Washington] and click\nonce for an input and once again for an output [to disseminate]\nmaterial to analysts anywhere.\"\nBut the new reality is a volume of message traffic that confounds the imagination. In fact, the latest Glimmerglass orders\nare contingent on providing a capability to look remotely at\nhundreds of locations and monitor them.\nFiber-optic landing stations, perhaps several, are on the\ncoasts of major countries. Fiber-optic cables come out of the\nAtlantic in New Jersey, the Baltic in Stockholm or via the Suez\nCanal into Cairo. In terms of communications, fiber optics are\nsweeping the globe. About 95% of the world's international\ncommunicationstraffic is carried by fiber optics, and most of\nthat goes under the sea.\n\"We believe our 3D MEMS technology-as used by governments and various agencies-is involved in the collection\nof intelligence from sensors, satellites and undersea fiber\nsystems,\" May says. \"We are deployed in several countries\nthat are using it for lawful interception. They've passed laws,\npublicly known, that they will monitor all international traffic for interdiction of any kind of terrorist activity.

Officials in the Navy's new P-8 patrol aircraft\nprogram are considering fiber optics for the mission systems.\nThe Army's difficulties in fielding an Airborne Common Sensor for signals and imagery intelligence was triggered by a\nrequirement for too much equipment without sufficient power\nand cooling. Fiber optics are viewed as part of the solution\n\nto outfitting smaller intelligence-gathering aircraft with the\nneeded sensors.\nThey also are expected to be in most proposals for a large\nNational Cyber Range. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is looking at remote sites in China Lake, Calif.,\nHolloman AFB, N.M., and perhaps Texas.

    "text": "Cornbatting theTaliban in\nCentral Helmand, Afghanistan\nAccelentingYour Mission.\n\nThe F i m Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles (1 RGR) is a British Battle-Group on operations in Helmand Province,Afghanistan.\nIn order to cope with a complex human terrain consisting of multiple a a o n with differing agendas, the Battalion chose to\nadopt unique intelligence fusion methodology in their Information Exploitation (K) Cell. A vast amount of information is\ncollected on a daily basis encompassing the full spectrum of human, communication and imagery related intelligence.\nIn order to sort through such large quantities of complicated data, the IX Cell uses i2's AnaE)st'sNotebook as its key tool\nto collect, analyse, and exploit information to target the Insurgency through focused operations.\n\n\"Counterinsurgency operations\nare complex to say the leasr\ngone is the conventional red and\nblue intelligence picture. We can\noperate in a complex human\nterrain comprising multiple acton\nand a constant stream of\nintelligence. i2's Analyst5\nNotebook has enabled us to\nembrace and understand this\ncomplexity.\n- Major Shaun W Chandler\nSituation\nRecently there has been a tendency to view military\nintelligence at the tactical level as being purely about\ncollection and upward passage of information, but in\ncounterinsurgency the expert is more often than not\nthe team working nearest t o the ground. They are the\nones who must start the analysis t o keep it from being\nmisinterpreted as it flows up the intelligence chain.\nWider compatibility and standardisation of procedures\nis imperative and when achieved, forms the backbone of\na powerful intelligence-led exploitation process.\n\nOverview\nLocation: Helmand Province,Afghanistan\nIndustry: Defence\nCustome~First BattalionThe Royal Gurkha Rifles\n\ni2 Products Used:Analyst's Notebook\n\n1 RGR, a light role infantry battalion currently serving in\nAfghanistan, is at the heart of this bottom-up analysis\nprocess. It is comprised of five companies, with sub-units\ntherein occupying their own Area of Operations. The\nBattalion's large geographical area of responsibility\nencompasses a large and varied population amongst\nwhom the Insurgents operate. In order t o understand\nthis area, each sub-unit has t o take ownership of their\nindividualAreas of Operation and pass data up t o\nthe Battalion Headquarters for fusion and further\nexploitation. Written intelligence summaries produce\nmany pages each day and the detail is quickly lost without\na programme such as Analyst's Notebook,which allows\nfusion of the information in terms of time, space\nand corroboration.\n\n\f!,,,-\n\nSolution\n1 RGR procured Analyst's Notebook because previous\nmethods of channelled intelligence were unable t o\nfacilitate the rapid fusion of intelligence required t o drive\nintelligence-led operations. By having all their information\ndeposited into Analyst's Notebook, it allowed the Battalion\nt o see a more complete picture, thus helping to minimise\nduplication of effort and maximise corroboration.\nAnalyst's Notebook more than adequately copes with\nthe complexity of data that the 1 RGR has t o analyse in\nsuch large quantities. A t current rates the Battalion is\nentering over a hundred entries a day, and without\nAna/yst's Notebook they would be unable t o exploit\nthis information.\n\nClpon deploymentAnalyst's Notebook allowed 1 RGR to\nachieve a more integrated and fully developed intelligence\npicture than ever before. They have been able t o identify\npatterns that would otherwise have gone unnoticed,\nallowing them to deliberately disrupt Insurgent activity.\nFurthermore, Analyst's Notebook has provided a greater\nunderstandingof the human terrain, equipping the\nBattalion t o be able t o anticipate the cause and effect of\ntheir actions and the opportunities that may arise for\nsubsequent exploitation of the Insurgency. Major\nChandler went so far as to say,\"The way our infantry\nBattalion approaches our intelligence role has been\nchanged for the better\"\n\ni2 Credentials\n\nAbout i2\n\nIn Afghanistan, 36 out of 44 countries involved in the\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) take\nfull advantage of i2 Defence Solutions to maximise\ntheir intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination\ncapabilities.\n\ni2 is the leading provider of intelligence and investigation\nsolutions for defence, national security, law enforcement\nand commercial security.

    "text": "Stopping Cyber Criminals\nin Their Tracks\nI\n\nI\nl\nI\n\nOf the many daunting challenges faced by law enforcement in investigating cyber crime, probably the most difficult is locating and\nactually putting handcuffs on cyber perpetrators. S f ret6 du Quebec, the police force of the Canadian province of Quebec, needed\na more effective way to map and connect the dots of a complex criminal computer network, in what would p m to be the\ncountry's largestar police operation conducted against hackers. The sophisticated entity resolution, data exbadon and\ncomplex analysis capabilities of i2's Cyber solution enabled investigators to navigate a maze of participantsand transactions, map\nthe network, and connect illegal actions to the cyber criminals, leadingto their arrest\n\n\"Befbmmopping in Cyber,\nI had d w k y u n d e ~ n d i n gthe\ninterndons in thousands of\nspreadsheet lines.\"\n\n- Inspector Fran~oisBlanchard, SOrete du Quebec\n\nOverview\nLocation: Quebec, Canada\nIndustry: Law Enforcement\nCustomer: SO&\nof Quebec\n\ndu Quhbec. the police force\n\nChallenge: Cyber Crime\n\nSituation\nIn 2008, Sfrete du Quebec, the police force of the Canadian\nprovince of Quebec, embarked on Operation \"Basiquen;\nat the time, this was the largest police operation ever\nconducted in Canada against cyber crime. Their target:\ncomputer hackers who had developed a network that\ncontrolled 100,000 personal and company computers in\n75 countries.\nBecause of the surreptitious nature of cyber attacks, and the\nmany layers and byzantine structures of a hacker network\nin many cases it can be next to impossible to track the\noriginators of online crime. The suspected hacker ring used\nmalware known as warms to infect the proxy computers used\nin their network Once infected, these computers were\nassembled into a sleeper network known as a BotNg which\ncould be commanded to launch virtual attacks against various\nlnternet sites.\n\nBotNets are rapidly rotating networks of hijacked computers\nthat criminals use as proxies to commit their attacks and\nmask their identities. As a BotNet grows, the origin and\n\ni2 Pducts Used\nCyber, Analyst's Notebook\n\nparticipants in the attacks become more geographically\ndispersed and the networks more complex and less\ncentralized. BotNets can even infect small applications that\ncan be inserted into social network sites such as Facebook\nand Linkedln.\nThe veil of the lnternet serves as a complex layer of\ninsulation and disguise between cyber criminals,their victims,\nand the law enforcement authorities attempting to investigate\nand prevent their illegal activities. Sfretk du QuCbec was\nusing a common spreadsheet software, which assembled\nhuge, cumbersome tables that required extensive manual\ncross-referencing. The police force needed a more effective\nway to cut through the complex maze of participantsand\nmap the network to the players and their transactjons.\n\ni 2 CUSTOMER S O L U T I O N CASE STUDY\n\n\fSolution\n\nOutcome\n\ni2 introduced SO& du Quebec t o the Cyber toolkit, which\nis an advanced analysis solution providing deep levels of\nconneaivity, activity and temporal mapping. (Since 2002,\nSO& du Quebec has also used 2's ihse, which captures\nand manages data and shares actionable intelligence that\nsupports intelligence-led operations.)\n\nThe SQred du Quebec estimated that the lnternet pirates\nhad caused damage totaling tens of millions of dollars, taking\ninto account the cost of repair or replacement of computers\nfor the affected victims. Among these were hotels in\nQuebec province and government institutions in Quebec\nand elsewhere in Canada that have not been publicly\nidentified. The cost to the victims could have been\nsignificantly higher as the hacker ring and their BotNet\ngrew, had they not been stopped when they were.\n\nAnalyst's Notebook, a key element of the Cyber solution set\nwas used to map the network Several layers of\ninvestigation were undertaken, which included analyzing\nmultiple data sets and tracing complex relationships and\ntransactions:\nldenofylng the hacking tools (\"worms\")being employed t o\ninfect computers and create the BotNet ring of slave\ncomputers\nTracing the route of the worm the hackers used to infect\nthe computers they wanted to control and finding which\ncomputers it had infected\nldentlfying the lnternet Protocol (IP) address of the\ninfected machines and defining the Uniform Resource\nLocator (URL) vectors of infection\nEstablishing the relationships of the slave machines that\nwere unknowing participants in the peer-to-peer network\nand connecting these infected computers t o the larger\nBotNet, being controlled by the hackers\n\nAbout i2\ni2 is the leading provider of intelligence and investigation\nsolutions for defense, national security, law enforcement and\ncommercial security.

It helps network equipment and software vendors to enhance their\nproducts with powerful and proven layer-7 protocol management capabilities. PACE has been optimized for performance and classification reliability. It is highly flexible and can be integrated in any existing platform such as firewalls,\nnetwork security appliances and lawful interception systems.\n\nAPPLICATION SCENARIOS\nNext-Generation Firewalls &\nWAN Optimization Controllers (WOC)\nReliably classify network protocols and apqlications, independent of TCP and UDP ports, for\nnetwork access control\nTraffic Analysis, Accounting & Billing Systems\nCollect detailed statistics based on actual\nprotocol and application usage for network\nresource planning, billing and accounting\n\nBandwidth Management\nNetwork bandwidth management t o provide\nquality of service (QoS) i n fixed-line and mobile\nnetworks with per-protocol and per-application\nbandwidth priorities, guarantees and caps\nLawful Interception\nReliably classify intercepted traffic for negative\nand positive filtering, protocol-based load balancing and improved post-processing\n\n1 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nI\n\n\fADVANCED DEEP PACKET INSPECTION ENGINE\nPACE is a software library which detects and classifies protocols and applications from a network packet stream.

All Rights Reserved.\n\n\fPERFORM\nBROADAND SURGICALCRAWLS\nOSlNT projects use different crawl techniques at different\nstages of an investigation but most approaches and COTS\nproducts cannot accommodate this requirement. In the\nearly stages a \"broad\" crawl is often used-but other\nsolutions cannot scale sufficiently to support the high\ndata volume that Katalyst can manage. Kapow Katalyst\nusers routinely access thousands of web sites in a session\nwith linear scaling. In later stages \"surgical\" crawls will\nseek to develop in-depth information on a narrow subject\narea. This type of crawl requires advanced website\nnavigation and data transformation abilities and produces\na much richer data set.\nSurgical crawls can become quite sophisticated as\nanalysis requirements become better understood. For\nexample, it is often necessary t o provide context and\nsemantic richness as soon as an extracted item is\nrecognized, rather than in a downstream process. For\nexample, by recognizing a known terrorist during a broad\ncrawl, a surgical crawl could be triggered to extract\nadditional contextual data from internal and external\nsources. Then, by providing metadata and data facets\nbased on context available only during the crawlcontext unavailable later-downstream analysis tools can\ncreate timelines, scatter plots, heat maps, relationship\ngraphs, and other advanced data representations t o\nfurther assist analysis. Kapow customers routinely use\nKatalyst to perform this kind of access.\n\nHarvesting Deep Web data is much more complex than\nmere link-following, and Kapow Katalyst offers unique\ncapabilities that enable Deep Web access.

Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\n\n\fExecutive Summary\nIntelligence agencies across the Federal government are turning to OSlNT for the additional breadth and\ndepth of information that it promises t o deliver. For example, DOD Instruction 3115.12 directs DOD t o\n\"pursue the full integration and exploitation of open sources for intelligence purposes\" and Intelligence\nCommunity Directive (ICD) 200 states that \"Analysts must be able t o find, access and share information,\nanalytic judgments and each other in any media and in real time.\"\nHowever, unlike typical IT systems which can accept only a limited range of input, OSlNT data sources\nare as varied as the lnternet itself-and will continue to evolve as technology standards evolve.\nThis white paper will alert you t o the key issues that can derail any OSlNT project. We will focus on the\nthree major functional areas relevant t o any OSlNT capability:\nData Harvesting: this is the \"front end\" of any OSlNT process. Raw data is accessed, extracted\n\nfrom the irrelevant content that surrounds it, enriched with attribution that is available only as\ndata is being harvested, and prepared for downstream use\nData Integration: in this part of an OSlNT process, raw data is integrated, enhanced, and\n\nenriched according t o the requirements of the specific mission\nMission Support: after an OSlNT capability has been developed, additional functionality will be\nneeded t o support and enhance the capability as mission parameters change\nThis white paper will also illustrate the advantages that have led over 500 customers-including\ndefense, intelligence, law enforcement, and other Federal agencies-to select Kapow as a key\ncomponent of their OSlNT data collection and acquisition strategies. With Kapow Katalyst these\norganizations discreetly capture more data faster, and respond more quickly to changing conditions.\n\n02011,Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\n\n\fOSINT: Architecture Overview\nJust as each agency has a unique mission,\neach supporting OSINT initiative has unique\nrequirements. However, after years of\n\nEnrich\n\nexperience the OSINT community has\n0\n\nbegun t o develop a set of best practices,\ncoalescing around architecture broadly\n\nWeb Data\nEnhanc\n0 Y\n\nsimilar t o the illustration on the right.\nIn this highly abstracted view, an initial step captures raw internet data and prepares it for a series of\nsubsequent processing steps. These subsequent steps carry out a wide variety of mission-specific\nprocessing on the harvested data, enhancing and enriching it, and ultimately preparing a corpus for\nanalysis. Finally, intelligence analysts access the corpus to carry out their work with additional missionspecific tools. In most cases a feedback loop is used when interim results expose the need to further\naugment the corpus by acquiring and enhancing additional raw data in a new cycle.\n\nHarvesting Data from the lnternet\nAlthough the above abstraction applies\nt o virtually all intelligence gathering and\nanalysis efforts, OSINT practitioners\nfocus on harnessing the breadth and\ndepth of data available on the Internetmore specifically, on accessible websites\nboth inside and outside their agency's\nfirewall-and making this data\nmeaningful and available to analysts.\n\nQ\n\nWeb Data\nEnhance\n\nKapow\nExtraction\nBrowser\n\nKapoW\nPartner\nEcosystem\n\nDefense and\nIntelligence\nCommunities\n\nExtracting data from web pages,\nhowever, presents a large number of\nsignificant technical challenges that must be resolved before regular operational use can be made of\nWeb-sourced data.\nFor example, extracting data from pages that use \"Web 2.0\" techniques-techniques that dynamically\nconstruct web page content and structure on-the-fly, as a page is being rendered-demands deep\nunderstanding of browser and JavaScript technology, and requires a protracted investment to ensure\nthat evolving standards and browser technology are supported in a timely manner.\nKapow Software has the kind of deep understanding that can be earned only through a decade of\nexperience, supported by continuous investment in browser-based data extraction. Kapow's unique\nExtraction Browser is in daily use across the defense and intelligence communities, extracting a wide\nvariety of data from websites around the world and preparing it for further enrichment by members of\nour partner ecosystem.\n\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\nS\n\nO\n\nF\n\nT\n\nW\n\nA\n\nR\n\nE\n\n\fModern Web Page Architecture\nThe very complexity of a modern Web page forms a significant barrier t o automated data extraction.\nAny given Web page is composed of a large number of elements with varying syntax and semanticsand because Web standards continue to evolve, continuous effort is needed t o stay current.\nEarly Web pages were coded only with HTML, which was used only t o specify how data was to be\nformatted for display. Each user request resulted in a complete unit of HTML being sent to the browser.\nHowever, as web standards have evolved, more advanced \"dynamic\" techniques have replaced static\nweb page construction, presenting much greater technical challenges.\nDynamic techniques, known\ncollectively as AJAX (Asynchronous\nClient Web\ncontained on\nWeb Page as\nPage\nThird-Party\nJavaScript and XML), enable a page t o\nViewed\nComponents\nServers\nbe built under control of one or more\nJavaScript programs that run in the\nbrowser client as the page is loading.\nThese JavaScript programs can\nperform a wide variety of actionsthey can alter page format, request\ndatabase access, send and receive\nmessages, load media files or\ndocuments, and even cause other\nJavaScript programs to be retrieved\nand executed. In addition, JavaScript is commonly used to capture web page analytics and select userspecific advertising to be displayed along with the requested page content. Pages built with AJAX\nroutinely involve multiple servers-not only the server hosting the selected Web page.\nSome solutions use the Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) API, but this has serious\nlimitations. The API itself does not provide access t o all of the page-creation activity necessary to\ncorrectly extract web data, and operationally it forces crawlers t o run on Windows.\nIn contrast, Kapow's Extraction Browser-used t o support your crawlers as they run-contains a full\nJavaScript engine that enables Kapow Katalyst t o see all dynamic activity as a web page is built, and\nKapow also handles cookies, session data, authentication data, and other browsing artifacts that allow\nsignificantly more complete data extraction . One critical advantage that Kapow 'S JavaScript engine\nprovides is the ability for you to alter the flow on any web page in real time-an advantage that\nimproves privacy and security as raw data is being captured. Finally, Kapow Katalyst supports Windows\nand several UNlX and Linux variations, giving you the widest range of deployment options.\n\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\n\n\fData Harvesting for OSlNT\nTo better understand why Kapow has become the web data extraction tool of choice this section will\nexamine each of the capabilities needed to harvest web data from a web site and prepare it for\ndownstream enrichment and enhancement.\n\nBroad vs. Surgical Crawl\nMost OSlNT efforts take the approach of casting a wide net during initial stages of investigation-often\ncalled a \"broad crawlu-and focusing more sharply with a subsequent \"surgical crawl\" t o fill important\ngaps in knowledge. Most automated approaches and COTS products fail because they are unable to\naccommodate both requirements.\nA broad crawl will generate a high volume of data but most solutions cannot scale sufficiently t o support\nhigh data volume. Kapow Katalyst is unique in this regard; it offers multi-server configurations that\nprovide linear scalability capable of supporting the largest of crawls. Kapow customers routinely access\nthousands of web sites in a completely automated manner without experiencing bottlenecks.\nSurgical crawls, often developed later in a project, typically require a different set of capabilities. For\nexample, extracting data from news sites or blogs will require the ability to navigate through a series of\nmenus, enter search criteria, scroll through a variable number of web pages, and extract only the latest\ndata from a variable number of entries on each page. This enhances data quality and removes noise that\ndiminishes the quality of subsequent analysis.\nSurgical crawls can become quite sophisticated as analysis requirements become better understood. For\nexample, it may be desirable to provide greater context and semantic richness for specific extracted\nitems that are recognized, much as Google includes a map of Milton Keynes among the search results\nwhen \"MK6 4HH\" is entered. By recognizing a known terrorist during a broad crawl, a surgical crawl\ncould be triggered t o extract additional contextual data from internal and external sources. Then, by\nproviding metadata and data facets based on context available only during the crawl-context which is\nnot available later-downstream analysis tools can create timelines, scatter plots, heat maps,\nrelationship graphs, and other advanced data representations that can further assist analysis. Kapow\ncustomers routinely use Katalyst t o perform this kind of access.\n\nExtensible Data Extraction Support\nBecause it's not possible t o predict what type of data will need t o be extracted, both broad and surgical\ncrawls will need the widest possible data extraction functionality. Katalyst includes the ability to extract\nany type of data from any Web site, including text, Office documents, PDF, flat files, images, audio and\nvideo files, and even files accessible via FTP or other non-HTTP protocols.\nA wide range of transformation capabilities can be applied during initial data extraction or any time\nbefore data is delivered for further enrichment and enhancement, giving you the widest possible\nlatitude in designing a flexible extraction and delivery strategy. As one example of the sophistication\navailable, one customer that harvests academic papers from websites uses Katalyst to extract the\n\n02011,Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\nS\n\nO\n\nF\n\nT\n\nW\n\nA\n\nR\n\nE\n\n\fabstract from each PDF-formatted paper during the crawl-no other software is needed, and no code\nneeded to be written. Many other similarly powerful functions are available for use, saving development\ntime and improving crawl performance.\nIf you require specialized extraction or transformation capabilities beyond those provided with Kapow,\nyou can invoke Java or .NET applications, as well as Web services, as you are crawling a site. Because you\ncan create any specialized data extraction you wish, you can increase the quality of extracted data\nearlier in the process, improving responsiveness and moving closer to real-time extraction.\n\nNon-Attribution\nOSlNT collection often requires repeated visits t o a website, and it may become necessary to avoid\nbeing noticed. Kapow Katalyst supports the widest range of options for shielding your identity.\nYou can examine and alter the execution of any JavaScript code on a page before it is run, enabling a\nbroad range of techniques for protecting identity such as defeating the use of JavaScript intended t o\ntrack visitors. Kapow Katalyst also provides a wide range of ways to alter the flow of a crawler to make it\nmore human-like-by inserting dynamic wait intervals, by crawling at different times of day, and by\nlimiting the number of clicks in a crawl. Kapow Katalyst can also obscure its origin and appearance as it\nruns, by altering the HTTP header that contains identifying metadata such as operating system,\nbrowser/version, and referring URL. Kapow Katalyst can use proxy servers, can integrate with third-party\nanonymization solutions, and can even detect when access has been blocked during a crawl and\nrespond by changing proxy servers dynamically during a crawl. Finally, by enabling access to a site's UI,\nKapow Katalyst lets you avoid registering for API access-likely drawing less attention.\n\nResilience to change\nWeb sites change daily and some data extraction techniques are highly sensitive to even the smallest\nchanges in page layout. Kapow's patented Extraction Browser is specifically designed t o be resilient.\nThe Extraction Browser has deep understanding of Web page structure, and operates on this underlying\nstructure of a page. Parameter-driven \"tag finder\" definitions mean that custom tags and syntax errors\ndo not disrupt processing, and help shield the Extraction Browser from future changes to standards and\ntechnology.\n\nFlexible crawl strategy\nEach OSlNT crawler will need to create a crawl strategy tailored to the specifics of the data sources and\nmission requirements, and strategies will vary widely. The Kapow Extraction Browser provides the\nwidest range of options for designing a crawl.\nKapow Katalyst can automatically authenticate to a site, perform complex navigation though menu\nstructures, supply input for any web form, navigate through multiple pages of output, and scroll through\nmulti-screen web pages extracting multiple occurrences of data. Crawlers can test for the presence or\nabsence of data or metadata anywhere on a page, and can change the course of a crawl at any point in\ntime. Extraction rules can process as many paths for a page as desired.\n\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\n\n\fIn one case Kapow Katalyst was able to penetrate a Flash menu built expressly t o protect a hacker site\nfrom \"web scraper\" tools, which simply do not offer the same functionality\n\nMultiple language support\nWhenever multiple language support is a\nrequirement, Kapow Katalyst offers built-in\nsupport for single- and multi-byte character\nencodings, as well as support for bidirectional\nlanguages such as Arabic and Hebrew. Kapow\nKatalyst correctly captures and processes data\nfrom news sites, blogs, RSS feeds, and social\nmedia sites around the world.\nThe screen image to the right\nillustrates Kapow's Design Studio\nbeing used t o extract data from an\nArabic language website. The\nDesign Studio's graphical editor\nallows precise visualization of\nselected data in any language and\nencoding, enabling point-and-click\nextraction of data from any\npage-even when the website\ndoes not advertise the encoding.\nAs a pure Java application, Kapow\nKatalyst uses Unicode natively, and data can be saved in UTF-8 or UCS-16. The Kapow Software product\nline follows all 118n guidelines, and multi-byte support is fully integrated throughout.\n\nSecurity\nMany websites require a user to authenticate before accessing some or all of the site's contents. The\nExtraction Browser has the ability t o enter any user ID and password into the site's authentication page,\njust as it can mimic any other action a human user would perform (such as navigating through menus,\nscrolling through multiple page outputs, and entering data into forms). These access credentials can be\nstored for automated use, or a user can be required t o re-enter them for each crawl, according to\nrequirements. If a site uses PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), Kapow also has the ability t o use authenticate\nusing a digital certificate.\nSeveral additional security measures can be applied. You can restrict data transfer to a specific IP\naddress, port, and socket, and can use SSL for all communication among Kapow Software components.\nAPI access t o Kapow crawlers can support ACL and security, and additional security measures can be\ndiscussed on request. Finally, the Kapow Extraction Browser is stateless, so it can safely reside in your\nDMZ: there is no risk of compromising data because no data is retained by the Extraction Browser.\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\nS\n\nO\n\nF\n\nT\n\nW\n\nA\n\nR\n\nE\n\n\fKapow Katalyst is currently in use on several secure networks, including SIPRNET, JWICS, and NMCI.\n\nAutomated data de-duplication\nOnly a small fraction of a typical website's content ever changes once it has been placed online. On a\nnews site, for example, even though the relative newsworthiness of an article will alter the article's\nposition on the site over time, the article itself may never be updated-and the Extraction Browser can\ndetect whether the article has actually changed. Kapow Katalyst can report downstream whenever data\nhas been added t o a site, changed, or removed from a site, and duplicate data will never be delivered\nunless requested.\n\nOffline SnapShot\nStudying a private copy of a site-instead of the live site itself-offers\n\na number of advantages, so\n\nKapow provides the capability t o take a \"SnapShot\" of any web page, domain, or list of domains.\n\nA Kapow SnapShot is a complete, fully static copy created by extracting the results of all dynamic page\nconstruction activity. A Kapow SnapShot includes all images, documents, and other linked assets; all\nlinks are automatically rewritten to the local server where the SnapShot has been stored, and all\naccompanying metadata is written to XML or into a database for later analysis.\nYou can access a SnapShot offline without running the risk that the site owner will be alerted t o your\ninterest due to JavaScript execution of tracking code on the live page. Only Kapow offers both-a static\nSnapshot, and the ability to harvest data from a live site.\n\nAdvanced Data Normalization\nCommon on websites is the use of relative dates and time stamps such as \"one minute ago\" or\n\"yesterday\" and the extraction technology must be able to convert these into usable data. Kapow's\nability t o convert relative times into usable dateltirne stamps is especially important to engage at the\npoint of capture, because this data cannot be accurately recreated downstream.\nKapow can also access metadata and expose it as data usable by downstream processes. For example,\nsome sites use color t o indicate the status of an item on the page; other solutions cannot normalize this\ntype of metadata into data that is useful.\n\nDeep Web Access\nNot all data is readily available on standard web pages. Experts estimate that the \"Deep Web\"consisting of web pages built from queried databases and similar dynamic content-may\n\nbe 20x larger\n\nthan the \"Surface Web\" that is accessible by crawling hyperlinks. OSlNT programs cannot afford to\nignore the Deep Web, but harvesting Deep Web data is much more complex than mere link-following.\nFor example, a given mission may require capturing data from the databases and content management\nsystems used to support a particular website, and storing it in a local database designed for analyst use.\nWith i t s ability to navigate complex menu structures and generate input for web-based forms, Kapow\nKatalyst can automatically issue multiple queries to display the desired data. Coupled with its ability to\nnavigate through multiple pages of output and extract data from multiple items on each page, Kapow\n02011, Kapow Software.

Kapow's de-duplication can be used to automatically keep it current. Other technology,\nlimited t o following specific links that already exist, will be unable to perform.\n\nData Integration for OSINT\nThis section examines requirements generated by the need to integrate raw data into downstream\nenrichment and enhancement processes.\n\nBroad-Based Support for Standards\nA recent Federal best practice study makes it clear that standards-based products are essential for any\nsuccessful OSlNT initiative. Because no single vendor provides everything a mission will require, it will be\nnecessary for each OSlNT program to integrate the technology it requires-and this integration will be\nmuch easier when proprietary solutions are avoided. Processes that provide raw data t o downstream\nenhancement and enrichment technology occupy a special position in the architecture, and bear a\nconcomitant responsibility to support the widest possible range of industry standards; otherwise,\nimplementation options will be needlessly restricted.\nKapow supports the widest range of integration standards available. In addition to native support for\nXML, HTML, JSON, JMS, and CSV, Kapow can also deliver results into SQL databases and XML\ndatabases-and can create numerous other formats. Data can be exposed as Web services (SOAP or\nRESTful) and can be callable via Java or .NET interfaces. Unlike other solutions, Kapow Katalyst-based\ncrawlers can direct output to any of these formats without being updated-a run-time choice selects the\ndesired output format.\nFinally, Kapow Katalyst can drive content into any Web application via its UI, by automatically\ncompleting the forms used to control the application. No other solution provides this range of design\nalternatives for planning your OSlNT architecture.\n\nNear Real-time Access\nThe same Federal best practice study also points out the desirability of \"enriching the dataset as it is\ncrawled\" t o enable near-real time access and improve responsiveness-especially important when\nconditions are changing rapidly. This can be accomplished by having the crawler manage some portion\nof the enrichment (by invoking whatever enrichment services are needed) before it pushes the enriched\ndata downstream (either directly into the corpus or via whatever standards-based interface has been\nchosen).\nJust as Kapow can invoke Web services, Java, or .NET applications during a crawl, it is possible t o\nconfigure Kapow to directly invoke downstream enrichment capabilities during a crawl. This capability\n(perhaps most useful during a surgical crawl where a small amount of data needs enhancement) allows\nthe OSlNT architect to decide based on mission parameters, and not technical limitations, whether realtime enhancement is needed.\n\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\nS\n\nO\n\nF\n\nT\n\nW\n\nA\n\nR\n\nE\n\n\fPartner Ecosystem\nAlthough any successful OSlNT effort will combine a variety of common techniques such as geotagging,\nentity extraction, language translation, and other types of enrichment, each OSlNT initiative is unique.\nDepending on its mission, each project will be a mix of assembling COTS software and creating missionspecific capabilities, but cost and risk will be reduced by choosing technology that has already been\nproven to interoperate.\nKapow Software has an extensive partner ecosystem that includes key vendors and integrators that\nspecialize in Federal projects, and we have jointly delivered a variety of OSiNT projects. You can feel\ncomfortable focusing on your OSlNT requirements, knowing that Kapow and i t s partners are dedicated\nt o your success.\n\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\n\n\fMission Support for OSlNT\nThis final section discusses issues relevant t o launching and operating your OSlNT capability.\n\nOperational Agility\nMost OSlNT missions will need to change over time: sometimes slowly, as mission parameters are\nrefined through greater understanding, and sometimes rapidly, in response t o conditions on the ground.\nCrawlers will need to be created or enhanced as greater understanding is attained, and new types of\ndata will need t o be extracted as they are found t o be relevant to the mission.\nKapow provides agility in multiple ways. First, unlike other solutions, Kapow does not require a separate\ncrawler for each site. Sites that share similar characteristics-blogs, for example-can typically use the\nsame crawler because Kapow operates on the underlying Web page structure, not the presentation\ndetails of a given site. Kapow Katalyst also enables run-time redirection of output t o a different format\n(e.g. SQL database, XML, CSV, RSS) allowing a given crawler t o meet the needs of multiple downstream\nprocesses over time. Any crawler can be exposed as a SOAP or RESTful service, or called from .NET or\nJava; when combined with Kapow's resilience to web site changes this gives the best kind of agility,\nwhere an external change incurs zero, or near-zero cost.\nWhen it comes time t o extract additional raw data-say, to develop a new surgical crawl-Kapow's\nintegrated repository makes it easy to share extraction and transformation rules, and the Design Studio\nsupports rapid, point-and click creation of new crawlers, new extraction rules, and new transformation\nrules-often in hours. Analysts can develop their own automated data collection processes, and run\nthem on demand or on a scheduled basis. Kapow also lends itself t o a Center of Excellence organization\nif preferred, allowing extraction skills to be collected in a shared-services model.\nFinally, Kapow provides the support you need to handle real-time enhancements t o mission\nrequirements as conditions change on the ground. For example, in response t o the January 2011\ngovernment-initiated Internet blocking in Egypt, Google created www.speak2tweet.com-a service that\nrecorded voice messages left on a pool of standard phone lines and automatically created a Twitter post\nwith a link to the recording. Enhancing a Kapow crawler to extract the audio and pass it downstream for\nstorage and analysis would take under 15 minutes, start to finish.\n\nScalability\nPerformance is critical in any large-scale initiative such as OSlNT data capture, and high performance\nneeds t o be designed in from the start. Kapow Katalyst was designed with linear scalability in mind,\nachieved through advanced design and rigorous testing.\nKapow's stateless design improves security, scalability, and availability, and supports the use of internal\ncloud-like resources t o enable smooth scaling upward during periods of high load. Each crawl runs\nindependently, in its own thread, providing the linear scalability needed to support extremely high\nvolume crawls.\n\n02011, Kapow Software. All Rights Reserved\n\n\fProduction Support\nFor OSlNT systems that will be run on a production basis it will be necessary to have access t o a high\nlevel of support, both from the vendor as well as from internal IT resources. Kapow provides secure\nweb-based tools that simplify all phases of IT involvement.\nKapow offers user, role, and group-based control over administration and deployment of the crawler\nenvironment, allowing secure deployment even in a shared-services organization. Fully-automatic\nscheduled crawls are provided, along with support for major monitoring standards such as JMX t o\nensure smooth execution and rapid detection of outages should they occur. Kapow Katalyst provides\nerror logging that can be directed to files, databases, emails, and even custom formats-all completely\nsecured. Error correction and redeployment are integrated, requiring just a click t o restart.\nFinally, as a company Kapow's support team is available 24x7 to assist with software issues.\n\n02011, Kapow Software.

In the\nearly stages a \"broad\" crawl is often used-but other\nsolutions cannot scale sufficiently to support the high\ndata volume that Katalyst can manage. Kapow Katalyst\nusers routinely access thousands of web sites in a session\nwith linear scaling. In later stages \"surgical\" crawls will\nseek to develop in-depth information on a narrow subject\narea. This type of crawl requires advanced website\nnavigation and data transformation abilities and produces\na much richer data set.\nSurgical crawls can become quite sophisticated as\nanalysis requirements become better understood. For\nexample, it is often necessary to provide context and\nsemantic richness as soon as an extracted item is\nrecognized, rather than in a downstream process. For\nexample, by recognizing a known terrorist during a broad\ncrawl, a surgical crawl could be triggered t o extract\nadditional contextual data from internal and external\nsources. Then, by providing metadata and data facets\nbased on context available only during the crawlcontext unavailable later-downstream analysis tools can\ncreate timelines, scatter plots, heat maps, relationship\ngraphs, and other advanced data representations to\nfurther assist analysis. Kapow customers routinely use\nKatalyst t o perform this kind of access.\n\nHarvesting Deep Web data is much more complex than\nmere link-following, and Kapow Katalyst offers unique\ncapabilities that enable Deep Web access.

The processor uses a patent-pending\ninterferometer DF technique typically providing 3 degrees RMS of DF accuracy, as well as\nexcellent sensitivity to distinguish a variety of signals. SIGpac provides superior performance\nwith most modulation types including CW, USB, LSB ,AM, ISB and FM.\nThe lightweight, low profile, combat-proven MA-445C HFNHFIUHF antenna provides\naccurate DF coverage from 2 to 2000 MHz. Built in flexibility allows for the use of antennas\noptimized for specific RF environments,as well as quick integration to ground mobile, maritime, or fixed-site missions.\nThe use of a low-power design and effective power management allows the system to be\noperated using the internally-mountedstandard military batteries. Multiple power sources can be\nutilized with use of an external adapter including vehicle, shore and generator power at 110 or\n220VAC at 50 or 60 Hz.\n\nSlGPAC IS OPTlMlZED FORTHE\n\nTACT~CAL\nSlGlNT M ~ S S ~ OBY\nN\nPROVIDING:\nSIGNAL ENVIRONMENT\nCHARACTERIZATION\nSIGNAL EXPLOrrATION\nSIGNAL LOCATION\n\nl\n\n~\n\n,\n\nLinkabit\n\n\fSIGpac Man Portable Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) System\nProduct Specs\n0.5 - 3000 MHz DF and Intercept (Receiver)\n2 - 2000 MHz (with MA-445C)\n3\" RMS Typical\n1\"\n10 pV/m (nominally)\nFM, AM, SSB, CW, 21SB\n10 Hz\n15ms\n75 dB or greater\nIntegrate multiple LOB estimates, up to at least 30, for\nenhanced accuracy\nProvide operator-selectableDF integration time\nProvide internal storage for at least 100 LOBS\n(including timestamps)\nProvide built-in-test (BIT) to the card level\n115 pounds\n5 6.0 inches (without whip)\n12.0 square feet\nEthernet 101100 or USB\n1 9 meter SEP\n1lmeter\nBearing accuracy: 11\"\nBearing resolution: 10.1\"\n\nFrequency Coverage\nDF Accuracy\nDF Resolution\nDFThreshold\nDemodulators\nTuner Frequency Resolution\nTuner Tuning Speed\nTuner Dynamic Range\nProcessor\n\nAntenna Weight\nAntenna Height\nAntenna Area\nRemote Interface\nPosition Accuracy\nPosition Resolution\nElectronic Compass'\nPhysical Characteristics System\nSize:\nWeight:\n\n3.50\" H X 9.23\"W X 11.05\" D\n1 2 7 pounds\n(excluding antenna mount, and power source)\n20 to 30 VDC (stand-alone),\n9V to 36V (with external adapter)\n5 15 Watts when fully operational\nBB390, BB390B, BB590, BB590MB\nBB2590, BA5390, BA5590\n\nPower Input\nPower:\nBattery Type:\nEnvironment\nOperatingTemperature:\nStorage Temperature:\nHumidity:\nAltitude:\nSubmersion:\nRain, Salt Fog, Vibration:\n\n-20\" to +60°C\n-40\" to +55\"C\n5% to 95% Condensing\n15,000 feet\n1 meter (3 feet) for 1 minute\nTested to MIL-STD-810Fmodified\n\nResistant to externally generated radio frequency interference (RFI)\nIn accordancewith MIL-STD-461E, tests CE102, CE106, CS101,\nCS103, CS114, CS115, CS116, RE102 and RS1\nNote: All specifications subject to change without notice\n\nCleared by DoDIOSR for Public Release\nUnder 10-S-3026 on August 24,2010.\n\nLlNKABlT DIVISION\n\n3033 X I E N C E PARK ROAD, SAN DIEGO, C A 92121\n(858) 552-9555 FAX (858) 552-9668 WWW.L-3COM.COM\nProduct Service Help D e s l c 1-800-331-9401\ne-mail: LinkabitProducts@ L - 3 c o m c o m\n\n\fMA-445C\nHFIVHFIUHF DF Antenna\nThe MA-445C HF/VHF/UHF DF Antenna provides accurate direction finding\n\n( D F ) over the 2 to 2,000-MHz frequency range in a small and lightweight unit.\nThe antenna was designed for use on vertically-polarized ground wave\nand sky wave signals.

The Collector parses the IPFlX packets, placing the information in a log file for real-time analysis andlor in a database\nif persistent storage is desired or required.\nThe SessionVistam CX-10 Collector organizes the protocol attributes in the database such that the information is readily\nretrievable, enabling rapid development of a variety of custom applications based on OTS or proprietary data analysis programs.\nContent data extracted by the Exporter, such as email/lM messages and VOlP calls, is received by the Collector via Mantaro's\nproprietary MCDP protocol running over an SCTP or TCP socket. The received packets are parsed and the content files are\nstored using a standard file system for real-time or offline analysis.\nThe SessionVistaWCX-10 Collector is a high performance multi-threaded software applicationthat runs on Linux.\n\nKey Features\nScalable and robust architecture: The Collector is architected in such a way that its performance scales as the host platform's\nperformance scales. Multiple packet queues ensure that data is not lost even at higher speeds.\nStandardized Software solution: The Collector is an application that runs on standard Linux distributions. It will run on any 64bit off the shelf x86 system with sufficient memory and disk space.\nMany Database Options: Support for Teradata and MySQL currently with plans for IBM and Oracle databases on the roadmap.\nDatabase interface code is tuned to optimize record insertion speed.\nComplete Database Schema: All IPFIX metadata is accessible from the database through a custom database schema with\nsupport for more than 300 protocols and 3000 metadata attributes. The schema is consistent across all supported databases.\nLog File Output: Support for log file output of IPFIX metadata for quick and easy integration with log management and indexing\nsolutions such as SplunkTM.\nContent File Management and Storage: Storage of content information such as email attachments, IM conversations and VOlP\nR I P streams on the file system. The content management function includes content pruning options where old data will be\nremoved if needed so that the platform's disk space is well utilized.\nEase of configuration: The configuration of the SessionVistaTMCollector can easily be changed through a GUI that allows\nselection parameters such as database type and log file enableldisable.\nMultiple connections are supported: The SessionVistaTM\nCX-10 will support connections from multiple SessionVistaTM\nExporters.\n\nApplications\nThe system, platform and components support a wide range of application possibilities including:\n\nNetworking\nNetwork monitoring\nCALEA\nTraffic shaping\n\nNetwork Security\nThreat detection and resolution\nPattern matching and historical\nanalysis\n\nData Analytics\nData mining\nVisualization\n\nMantaro Product Development Services Inc.\n20410 Century Blvd., Germantown M D 20874\nWWW.MANTARO.COM info@mantaro.com 3 0 1 528 2244\n\n\f",

    "text": "WIR VERSTEHEN DIE ZEICHEN DER ZElT\nKEEPING PACE WITH THE SIGNAL OF TIME\n\nIntelligence Fusion System\nAcquisition - Processing - Analysis\n\nIFS-8000 is a flexible, scalable and modular IT system to support the\nprocesses for case-oriented condensation of information to reports.\nStandard products for information processing and workflow design in\nthe back office are configured according to the task. Embedding of\ncommercial solutions for processing and analysis of contents is o p\ntionally possible and provided. Project oriented processes for business management are part of the solution.\n\n\fOverview\n,\n~nalyses,situation validation and the exploitation of decision basics usually reqwfre the consolidation of different relevant data, and the condensation to reports. Tasks\nIlib these occur in most types of institutions and organisations. In the sovereign envient, these requirements are present in security oriented situation and evaluation\nes. In industrial environment, tasks in the range of business intelligence define the\n\nTask\n\nI\n\nF'\n\nnumber of data sources of different types is continuously increasing. Business speand organisation specific information appear at different times and mostly without\nntext. All report data are based on raw information that is fed into the processing sysfrom different sources via different interfaces. Unstructured contents and structured\nmeta data are differentiated. The latter can be managed by means of data bases.\n\n-\n\nI\n\n'The inspection of the data and information must flexibly follow the demand. Compressed\nnvisualisationsare gained by a relevant data selection by suitable analysis and visualisation tools for the reports.\nIFS4000 provides different tools to support data and information processing and to improve the efficiency and quality of the analysis processes. Generation of meta data from\nunstructured images, texts and audio data is embedded in the workflows. Valuable results are archived for later evaluation.\nIFS-8000 orients itself at the \"Intelligence Cyclen describing the\ngenerally valid steps when evaluating information. This term was\noriginally introduced in the military\nand intelligence service reconnaissance environment and is\ntoday used in matters of business\nintelligence to describe a typical\nand commonly used workflow.\n\nIntelligence\n\nThe evaluation cycle starts with the request of the leadership to create a case based or\nrequest based report.\n\nRequest e m\nLeadership\n\nI\nS\n\nF\n\nSeveral sub-steps result from the request prepared according to the requirements in a\nplanning process. Workflows and a mission schedule for the available resources are\nthe results.\nResults of the planning process are requirements for the collection of suitable raw in;formation as needed for the generation of reports. Accordingly, the available data\nsources are used or requested to make the data available for further processing.\n\nc011ecttd\n\nI\n\nrrocessih\n\nThe raw material is processed. If possible, additional meta data are extracted from the\ncontents, or new representations of the contents are elicited. Automatic processing and\ninteractive processes are applied. Result of this step is raw data. These raw data are\nanalysed and evaluated in the next steps. All these processing steps are mapped to\nworkflows and organised by a workflow management system.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAnalysis is conducted by means of different tools that are applied according to the requirements and support the analysing operator in a suitable manner.\n\nReporting\nDisseminal\n\n\\\n\nThe results are issued as repotts and disseminated to the requesting leadership.\n\n130\n\nby MEDAV GmbH 2011\n\n- Spdfication subject to change -\n\nPage 218\n\n\fIFS-8000 System Architecture\n\n*\n\nThe figure gives an overview of the S\nm mponents\nthat are useful to understand the d\nent software\ncomponents and workflows. Information IS fed into the\nsystem via the gateway. The data storage strares the\ndata. A server farm provides the compbting power for\ndata processing as needed by the processed defined in\nthe SlPAC product. SOMOS provides the web b e d\nuser interfaces and the data base for data management. Several roles describe the tasks and the work\nplace descriptions for users and evaluatq using the\nsystem to fulfil their tasks.\n\nSnalysi\nTools\nLoc-DE\n\nO by MEDAV GmbH 2011\n\n- Specification subj9\n\n.=-\n\nLA lcr.\n\n\fSystem Components\nData and information from different sources are fed into the system via\na specially suited gateway. Data are stored in a standardised data\nbase (UC-DB: Universal Collection Data Base) and are available for\nfurther processing.\n\nSlPAC\nSignal Intelligence Processing Analysis Component\nSIPAC provides a powerful framework for processing the input data.\nContents as well as structured meta data are processed and enhanced. Different methods and technologies are used and can be\nimplemented in software.\nSlPAC provides configuration and modular adding of functionalities by\nindependent software applications, such as OCR methods to convert\nimage information to text, text translation, or methods of pattern recognition in audio signals.\nCustomisation and test of the processing functions can be achieved by\ntraining in particular cases. Traceability guarantees a high quality level\nof these processes.\nSlPAC can execute different processing functions. Contents and meta\ndata of raw information are processed. Additional meta data are generated, or the contents of the data are displayed in different viewers.\nProcessing of unstructured data (image, text, audio) is a significant\nfeature of IFS-8000. This is in contrast to other information processing\nsystems used for business intelligence.\n\nSOMOS\nSupport and Organization Machine for Operators and Specialists\n\n'\n\nSoMoS\nUI-DB\n\n\nL\n\nSOMOS provides the user interface and different basic functions to be\nexpected and needed in any back office structure. This includes: organisation of demands, a document archive, support of internal communications, resource management, management of workflows, and\nstorage of the different case referred raw data within their relations. A\nBusiness Process Management System (BPMS) allows for free\ndefinition and support of workflows.\n\nAnalysis Tools\nIFS-8000 allows for embedding different analysis tools to support data\nprocessing and evaluation at the workplaces of the operators and\nanalysts. In addition to the traditional workplace (for example: MS\nOffice), IFS-8000 software can also be used for specialised, application referred tools.\nThe examples shown provide the possibility of map based viewing of\nevaluation results or for graphical criminalistic analysis. In principle,\nonly few restrictions to configure the system exist.\n\n\fProject Flow\nInstalling an IFS43000 system has usually a deep effect on existing structures\nand work flows. Similar to the introduction of ERP systems (Enterprise Resource\nPlanning), a solution consists of many different components to be selected and\nconfigured according to the demands.\nMEDAV provides a variety of standard software modules covering a wide range Softwal\nof functions. Especially the products SOMOS and SlPAC dominate the system\nand define the frame within the different specific elements and modules are embedded. SOMOS and SlPAC provide a wide range of configuration, modularity\nand scalability.\nIFS-8000 is not a static product, it is rather characterised by continuous development. The roadmap of the development is also influenced by requirements\noccurring in a project. The continuous development of available functions expands the functionality of the solution available to the group of all users after\ncompletion of the development as an element of the further product development in the form of new versions.\nMEDAV usually shares the costs for upgrades of this type. The ownership of the\nupgrades remains, therefore, at MEDAV, but usage is made available to customers by suitable licensing.\n\nS\"\n\nUsually, customer specific developments consider a small scale of project spe- Software pecitlc\ncific demands. MEDAV provides this either as service, or the customer provides\nMEDAV,customer\nthe adaptations on his own responsibility as a contribution under consideration\nof the interface specifications.\n\nB\n\nThe readjustment and reorganisationof the workflows require special considera- Consultin!\ntion of the users of the system. Existing workflows need to be analysed and opMEDAV\ntimised, if possible. The best opportunity to do so is switching from old processes to a new IT platform.\nUsers expect that their practice and orientations are considered. New processes\nand workflows must be understood and accepted whenever a new solution is\nexpected to be successful from the beginning.\nIt is important to plan carefully for the introduction of this process, similar to the\nintroduction of ERP systems, and to accompany and conduct the process with\ncertain, suitable solicitousness and sensitivity.\nAn important part is software contributed by specialised 3d party manufacturers. 3'C'Pa\nThese components are selected in regards of the special needs and requirements. A wide range of solutions is part of the skills of MEDAV and can be explained to the users directly. Additional software can be integrated for special\nrequirements.\nIFS-8000 consists of different hardware components as a platform for different 3rd\nIT components. These are especially: gateway, data storage, SOMOS server,\nHa\nserver f a n and work place computers for the different system users. The components are selected according to the requirements and are contributed by\nproven suppliers of IT components. Service and maintenance are normally\ngranted and conducted directly by the manufacturer.\n\n8 by MEDAV GmbH 2011\np-p\n\n- SpecificationS\n\n\fScope of Application\nIFS8000 is a flexible, modular, and scalable platform to support back office\nprocesses. Special focus is processing of non-numeric information and data. In\nthese regards, IFS-8000 is different from any other system for processing\n- sup\n\nERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is the business task to make most efficient\nuse of the company resources (capital, equipment, personnel) for operational\nprocesses and thus to optimise the controlling of business processes.\nIFS8000 helps in planning to make best use of the personnel resources of\nevaluation operators and analysts and their cognitive abilities in order to achieve\nand process information. From this, focus and application result of this type of\nsupporting systems.\n\nThe term forensic summarises the context in which criminal acts are systematically identified or excluded, analysed and reconstructed.\nProcessing intelligence information from different sources is a sovereign task\nprocessed by different organisations within a state. The goal is the determination\nof security relevant information and situation reporting on a regular basis.\nBusiness Intelligence has been popular since the mid 1990s and means processes for systematic analysis (collection, evaluation and representation) of data\nin electronic form. Goal is to gather knowledge allowing for better operative or\nstrategic business decisions to be made. This is done by means of analytical\nconcepts and IT systems evaluating data about the own business, the competitors or market trends. With this knowledge, enterprises can optimise their processes and make their customer relationships or deliverer relationships more\nprofitable, reduce costs, minimise risks, and add value. The term is commonly\nused in the scope of business informatics.\nNews agencies and press agencies deliver news with information on today's\nevents, and predefined news for mass media as newspapers or newscasts. Furthermore, PR agencies distribute information and press releases from press\noffices of enterprises and organisations. PR agencies and news agencies play a\ncentral role in the word wide information flow.\n\nSpecification subject to change\n\n-\n\nPage 618\n\n\fNotes\nIFS-8000 consists of different components defining the complete solution by ~ n t d\ntheir composition. Interfaces and IT relevant aspects are considered and aligned\nin the projecting phase.\nThe performance of the system is determined and defined according to the requirements. According to this, the system components are selected and provided in hardware and software.\n\nP\n\nAs a rule, applicable legal foundations in regards of export conditions are followed.

Sharing information can help\nprevent crime and terrorism before it occurs. Proactive law enforcement\nrequires putting together many pieces of a puzzle. While there is no\nguarantee that information sharing will prevent all attacks or crimes,\nfailure to do so will almost certainly guarantee future attacks and crime.\n'\"In the wake of the September 1l , 2001 terror attacks there has been a call for more and\nbetter intelligence to preserve domestic security. Much of the focus has been on improving\nand expanding existing federal mechanisms for ensuring national security. Equally\nimportant, however, is the need for more and better intelligence for and by state, local, and\ntribal law enforcement agencies.\nThe intelligence function can serve two broad purposes within law enforcement agencies:\nPrevention (Tactical Intelligence): This includes gaining or developing information\nrelated to threats of terrorism or crime and using this information to apprehend offenders,\nharden targets, and/or employ strategies that will eliminate or mitigate the threat.\nPlanning and Resource Allocation (Strategic Intelligence): This includes generating\ninformation to decision-makers about the changing nature of threats, the characteristics\nand methodologies of threats, and emerging threat idiosyncrasies for the purpose of\ndeveloping response strategies and reallocating resources, as necessary, to accomplish\neffective prevention.\n\nThe tragedies of 9/11 do not change the fact that LE1 (law enforcement intelligence) has\nthe capacity to support many functions within a police organization. In many communities,\nLE1 that supports local criminal investigations and improved management decision making\nmay be as valuable as LE1 that supports matters of homeland security.\"\n\np\n\ne\n\nr\n\na\n\nt\n\ni\n\na\n\nBeyond any dispute collection of information from different sources is recognized to be the\nbasis for all following steps in the work flow of intelligence organizations observing their\nduty to support the deciders and the leadership.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nMEDAV supplies with the products ARS-8000, CRS-8000 and MlRA all kind of\ncommunication intelligence systems, especially radio monitoring solutions.\nAdditional sensor systems are offered on request using a network of\ncooperation partners.\n\nThe fusion of information is a necessary step to produce intelligence and knowledge which\nis reported to the leadership. Strategic and tactical scenarios are part of the daily tasks and\ndetermine the way how to handle the special intelligence requirements.\nMEDAV supplies the IFS-8000 system which is designed as a modular, flexible\nand scalable IT platform for the organization of work flows in the intelligence\nback office including many dedicated support, processing and analysis tools.\n13FS integrates sensors, signal processing and analysis with the following processing and\nanalysis of intelligence.\n\nublished by the Futures Working Group (FWG), collaboration between the FBI and the Society of\nlice Futurists International (PFI). Its purpose is to develop and encourage others to develop\nts and strategies to ethically maximize the effectiveness of local, state, federal, and\nI law enforcement bodies as they strive to maintain peace and security in the 21st century.\nnf Law Enforcement Intelligence, Joseph A. Schafer & David L. Carter\"\n\n4 201 1 - Specification subject to change - Page 6116\n\n\f13FS is MEDAV's answer to the current challenges in law enforcement and national\nsecurity agencies worldwide. 13FS collects information from different sources and provides\nthe agency with all tools to process and a n a l p information efficiently. The puzzle,\nconsisting of single pieces of intelligence, is merged into the report and gives a complete\npicture supporting best situation awareness. The work flow is organized in a closed loop\nand allows tasking of the collection sensors.\n\nL\n\nIFS8000 is the modular IT platform which enables MEDAV and the end users to adapt the\nfunctionality of the 13FS system to the dedicated needs and requirements easily and target\noriented. Diverse powerful analysis tools provide functionality in the field of relationship,\ngeographic location, technical and speech signal analysis.\nMIRA, CRSSOOO and ARS-8000 are radio monitoring sensors allowing the collection of\nsignals and their processing, analysis localization and content production. Special\ncommunication collection systems, dedicated for different communication services,\ncomplement the scope of sensors and the availability of acquisition and interception\ncapabilities.\nThe following areas of applications are covered by the product family:\n\nI\n\nRadio Monitoring and COMINT in strategic and tactical scenarios\nRadio Monitoring for civil regulationauthorities\nEquipment for mobile platforms with radio monitoring and COMINT\nsolutions:\no\nspecial emergency vehicles for police and special task forces\no ships for the coast guard\no\nairborne platforms.\nSignal and speech analysis labs and work places\nSupport of strategic oriented security services and agencies under the leadership\nof the Minister of Defence or the Minister of Interior with Surveillance and\nInformation Processing solutions\nCommand - Control - Communication- Computer and Intelligence applicatiom\n\n(W\n\nI\n\nCompact solutions to su~Dort\n. . swcial task forces with dedicated IT solutions for,\nthe &bile use.\n\n--I-\n\n3I\n\n\f4\n\nRac\n\nI\n\nMonitorina\n\nSystems for radio monitoring can contribute significantly to the\nsuccess of the work within law enforcement and intelligence\nagencies. The central idea is that the bad guys are using\ncommunication systems during their operation leaving their\nmarks and electronic fingerprints in the air. The detection and\nidentification of the electro magnetic emissions and signals\nindicate behaviour, deployment and movement of threatening\ntask forces, terrorists or criminals. Those signals can be\ncaptured and analysed in different way by means of signal\nprocessing and analysis methods. Content is another\nimportant issue in analysing the intercepts.\nThe process usually generates information and intelligence in\nseveral steps:\nDetection\nIdentification\nClassification\nLocalization\nInterception\nContent production and analysis\nOSINT, COMINT, SIGINT, HUMINT and MASINT.\nThe complete set of collected transmissions are fused and\nanalysed in order to give an enhanced picture of the current\nsituation and situation awareness.

That fact,\ncoupled with the flexibility that SSL provides, has made it the obvious choice for securing a host of additional applications and to enable new services where SSL is used as a\nsecure tunneling mechanism.\nSpecifically, for end users, SSL has long been used to secure Web-based transactions to enable e-commerce and online banking. Over time, the simplicity that SSL\nprovides has made it the perfect vehlcle to migrate many applications to a Web-based\nmodel for new online services like viewing medical records, ordering prescriptions,\nfiling federal, state, and local tax returns and other government uses. In addition\nnew cloud based and enterprise applications such as Salesforce.com, Exchange,\nSharepoint and most of the web based email applicationson the market such as Gmail,\nYahoo, Zimbra etc.\nIn the enterprise, SSL is most often used to encrypt traffic leaving the enterprise to\nprovide data security between remote locations across a public network.. SSL is also\nused inside the enterprise to secure sensitive transmissions, such as human resource\ndata, between departments or groups and to ensure privacy for corporate activities,\nsuch as business development, mergers and acquisitions. Enterprises also require\nencrypted communications to individual mobile users who need remote access and\ntherefore SSL-based VPNs are a fast-growing technology for remote-access VPNs.\n\nSSL GROWTH\n\nWhile\nsolves many security Table I . SSL Deployment and Use\nproblems, encrypting sensitive\ntransactions can allow them to\npass through security measures\nunchecked. This fact is exacerbated considering that SSLencrypted communications constitute a significant and growing percentage of the traffic in enterprise LAN and WAN.\nSurveys have shown that between 2535% of enterprise traffic is SSL-encrypted, and can\nbe as hgh as 70% in select verticals.\n\n,\n\n-\n\nPROBLEM POSEDBY SSL\nIt is clear that there are legitimate needs for encrypted data within, to and from the\nenterprise. But this encrypted traffic poses a security risk as SSL also provides a\nmechanism for more nefarious applications. As many IT managers are aware, the\nprivacy benefits provided by SSL encryption can be overshadowed by the risks SSL\nbrings to the enterprise network. While SSL encryption provides privacy and can\nprotect both corporate and individual user information by ensuring that data is useless\nto potential interceptors, it can also make it difficult or impossible for network\nadministrators to enforce corporate acceptable-use policies. SSL also makes it difficult\n\nSSL traffic (encrypted traffic) in the enterprise is growing rapidly due to the enterprise-wide usage of applications, such as\nSharepoint, Exchange, WebEx, Salesforce.com and GoogleApps. Additionally,\nmost e-mail applications, such as Gmail,\nYahoo and Zimbra, all use SSL to encrypt\ncommunications.\nAlthough this enuyptedtrafficprotects\nend user data, it also creates security \"blind\nspots.\" The security infrastructure put in\nplace to protect your enterprise is blind to\nSSL traffic, thus causing risks for traffic destined to the enterprise. The same SSL encryption methods used to protect your data\nprovide an easy vehiclefor criminals to hide\ntheir cyber attack activities, as in the case of\nseveral recent well-publicizedattack\nIn addition to the risks of incoming\nthreats hiding over SSL channelsbypassing\nsecurity architectures, outbound enterprise\ntraffic is now a growing problem. This is becoming quite a \"hot 6utton\"for security applications that tackle data loss prevention\n(DLP), compliancereporting and lawful intercept solutions that could, at one time,\nsee what was outgoing, but are suddenly \"in\nthe dark\" to SSL traffic\nThis paper explores the drivers behind\nthe increase in SSL usage and the methods\nused by enterprisesto confront the security\nchallengesthat SSL creates.TheNetronome\nSSL Inspector offers enterprisesecurity appliances or applicationsunparalleledaccess\nto the unenuyptedplaintext of SSL flows for\ntheseapplications to be succerrful.\n\n-\n\nNETRONOME\n\n\fFigure l . Network appliances have failed to keep pace with improvements in network performance.\n\nNO VISIBILITY\n\nINCREASED VISIBILITY\n\nI\n\nI\nGlGABlT ETHERNET\nREDUCED THROUGHPUT\nfor IT organizations to ensure that threats, like viruses, spam and\nmalware, are stopped before they reach individual users. Without the ability to examine the contents of SSL communications,\nnetwork operators leave open the possibility for information to\nbe accidentally leaked out of the enterprise or worse, stolen.\nRegulatory compliance requirements, including identifying\naccidental or intentional leakage of confidential information, are\nalso virtually impossible to meet because of SSL encryption.\nIn many instances, there are conflicting requirements to\nboth encrypt and examine data within the enterprise. In typical\ninstallations, these seemingly incompatible requirements cannot\nboth be met with acceptable performance. This SSL conundrum\nhas wreaked havoc for organizations subjected to industry and\ngovernment compliance mandates, such as Health Insurance\nPortability and Accounting Act (HIPAA) and Sarbanes-Oxley\n(SOX), which require intrusion protection and detection to\nensure that only authorized individuals have access to hardware\nand software resources within the network infrastructure. Other\ncompliance mandates require all organizations with publicly\naccessible networks to be able to provide law enforcement\nagencies with documentation of network activity, thus requiring\nthat all traffic be unencrypted.\n\nSSL CONTROL\nAPPROACHES\nNetwork operators already deploy an array of network and\nsecurity a p p h c e s to protect their enterprises, enforce internal\ncorporate acceptable use policies and satisfy external government regulation. These devices provide solutions for detecting\nrogue applications, controlling unrestricted Web surfing, firewalling traffic, VPNs, network access control (NAC), intrusion\ndetection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), unified threat management (UTM), regulatory compliance, virus protection and\nspam control, amongst others. These appliances work almost\nentirely by providing deep packet inspection and flow analysis,\nlooking for known patterns of mischievous activity and blocking or recording it. Unfortunately, these network and security\nappliances, in many instances, can only inspect plaintext traffic\nand are unable to inspect SSL-encrypted communications for\nattack signatures. These solutions are thus becoming less and\nless effective, as the amount of encrypted SSL communications\nand traffic continues to grow.\nNetwork operators previously faced two extremes in\nconfronting the issues associated with SSL communications.\nThey could take a draconian approach by blockung SSL\ncommunications entirely or, alternatively, allowing SSL com-\n\nNETRONOME WHITE PAPER\n\nmunications transparently without inspection (by leaving port\n443 open on their security infrastructure), thereby greatly\nreducing the effectiveness of their network and security appliances that are unable to examine the encrypted flows. Neither of\nthese alternatives is a viable option for enterprise networks.\nBesides simply passing all SSL-encrypted payloads or blocking encrypted traffic entirely, several other approaches have been\nused. These methods share a common goal of providing plaintext inspection of SSL-encrypted flows, enabling the content of\nencrypted traffic that does not meet corporate acceptable-use\npolicies to be dropped or the logging of suspected attacks to a\nmanagement station. Just as importantly, these methods also\nneed to identify and permit SSL in legitimate use cases. In many\ninstances, these methods are successful at examining encrypted\nSSL, but they typically suffer other major problems that limit\ntheir effectiveness.\n\nSSL PROXIES\nToday, in most cases, network operators permit encrypted communications, but only through SSL proxies that allow the IT\norganization to examine and inspect SSL-encrypted content\nbefore entering or exiting the enterprise. These proxies provide\nthe opportunity to examine the contents of network traffic, yet\nstill offer encryption prior to leaving the enterprise.\nUnfortunately, traditional SSL proxies create additional\nproblems that become trade-offs to the security benefits that they\noffer. They are inserted in the network path and create congestion as the performance of the network appliance fails to keep\npace with the rate of expansion of network capacity and\nbandwidth at Gigabitdsecond and beyond. The network VO,\nmemory and CPU utilization of these systems all strain at these\nnew performance levels. As a result, these network appliances\nare rated for use by some amount of aggregate bandwidth or a\nnumber of users, sessions and/or flows. When any of these\nmetrics are exceeded, the appliance becomes a bottleneck\nthat can only be relieved by adding capacity with yet another\nnetwork appliance($.\nSSL proxies also require network IP address configuration\nand likely need network topology changes to engineer the\nappliance into the network as an active network element.\nAs an active network element with IP addresses on the in-line\ninterfaces, these SSL proxies are now vulnerable to all attacks\njust as any other host, server, switch or router would be.\nCareful consideration needs to be given to the security of the\nSSL proxy configuration itself in both the data plane and\nmanagement plane.\n\nExaminingSSL-encrypted Communications\n\n\n\fAnother issue with network designs based on SSL proxies\nis that these assume that all SSL traffic is blocked except that\nwhich goes through the proxy. Network devices redirect traffic\non port 443 to the proxy SSL proxies are incapable of detecting\nhidden SSL flows on different (non-443) port numbers because\nsuch traffic is not directed to the proxy.\nTraditionalSSL proxies also force costly changes to network\ntopology, firewall and policy configuration, as well as modification of clientlserver stations and their SSL-capable applications\nin the enterprise. Applications using SSL require the proxy\nserver's information, such as IP address, port number and,\npotentially, other security settings.\n\nnt balance\nseaurity\nce.\n\nTRANSPARENT\nSSL PROXIES\nAs network bandwidths expand and the complexity of\napplications and attacks increases, more networks are employing a multitude of network and security appliances and IP-based\napplications and services. Accordingly, interest in the use of\nSSL proxies has surged once again. Despite this and the\nexistence of many SSL products in the market, few solutions\nexist that can provide a high level of security with little or no effect upon management and performance.\nThe ultimate solution in ensuring the confidendty and protection of SSL traffic balances performance, control and security\nWhile solutions exist to meet each objective independently, it is\ndifficult to satisfy them simultaneously resulting in one or more of\nthese critical areas failing to meet expectations.Increasingsecurity\nat the expense of network performance or compliance is no more\nacceptable than meeting application bandwidth and compliance\nrequirements while ignoringsecurit)!To date, it has been difficult,\nif not impossible, to satisfy all three of these objectives.\nA new class of SSL proxy is entering the market that\nprovides many of the benefits of existing SSL proxies, yet also\nremoves or mitigates the negative impacts that are currently\nassociated with them. These devices, known as transparent\nSSL proxies, are deployed in the IP network where encrypted\nSSL traffic can be inspected as plaintext before it enters or exits\n\nNETRONOME WHITE PAPER\n\nthe LAN, WAN or data center. Their transparency is defined by\nthe fact that they are deployed as a \"bump-in-the-wire,\"meaning they are not active endpoints in the network. As a result,\nthey do not require any IP address assignment or configuration,\nremoving any complicated configuration requirementsor P network topology changes. They can easily be added or removed\nfrom the network by simply connecting or disconnecting their\ninput and output network connections. The transparency also\nmeans that the SSL proxy function is hidden from the end user,\nremoving the need for time-consuming and costly client device\nand application configuration.\nTransparent SSL proxies see all network traffic, not just SSL,\nand, thereby, require line-rate network performance and the ability to cut-through non-SSL flows. An effective transparent SSL\nproxy solution provides great performance at both the network\nand application levels as well as multiple-interface support for\napplications to tap into SSL streams. By providmg applications\nwith access to the plaintext in SSL streams, the transparent proxy\nenables IT managers to implement policy control and regulate\nnetwork users-often necessary for compliance.\n\nExamining SSL-encrypted Communications\n\n\n\fNetronome SSL Inspector\"\n\n-\n\n-3\n\nTransparentSSL Proxy\nThe Netronome SSL Inspector is the industryk hlghestperformance h-ansparrnt proxy for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) network communications,providing applicationswith access to the\nplaintext in SSL-encrypted connections. Beyond industrydefining performance, the Netronome SSL Inspector is the first\ntransparent SSL proxy that both increases network security and\nsipficantly minimizes deployment and operational costs by\nremoving costly user and network configuration. The SSL Inspector was designed for secunty and network appliance manufacturers, enterprise IT organizations and system integrators to\nprovide industry-leading performance at a fraction of the cost of\nother solutions. Without compromising any aspect of enterprise\nor government-regulated compliance, the SSL Inspector allows\nnetwork appliances to be deployed with the hghest levels of flow\nanalysis while still maintaining multi-gigabit, line-rate network\nperformance.\nThe Netronome SSL Inspector enables existing security and\nnetwork applications to obtain access to the plaintext wthin\nSSL-secured flows, thereby extending the benefits of their\napplications to SSL-encrypted traffic. Unmodified applications\nr u m g on the same platform as the Netronome SSL Inspector,\nor on adjacent appliances, can gam visibility into the content of\nSSL traffic. Netronome's network processing and cryptography\nacceleration hardware are leveraged to forward non-SSL traffic at\nmulti-Gbitls rates.\nThe SSL Inspector can be deployed as a \"bump-m-the-wire\"\nfully transparent proxy, el~minatingthe need for costly reconfiguration of network elements. This transparency removes any\nneeded configuration of clients and servers to make them direct\nSSL traffic towards the proxy The SSL Inspector just needs to\nbe located in-line so that all network flows (mcluding SSL flows)\npass through it.\nThe SSL Inspector can also be deployed in a passive mode\nof operation with the appliance connected to a span port, tap or\nmirrored interface where the SSL Inspector is receiving a copy\nof all network traffic for classification, flow identification and\ndecryption.This mode permits SSL inspection without the need\nto place an apphnce in-line.\nNetronome's solutions enable the identification and elirnination of risks, such as remlatory compliance violations,\nvirusdmalware and intrusio;attem;ts\nno&ally hidden within\nSSL. The privacy and integrity of SSL-encrypted communications are maintained by making the plainte\nable only w i h n a controlled environment\nwhile also exempting certain traffic from inspection based on user preference.\n\nPRODUCTOFFERINGS\nThe SSL Inspector is offered as a complete\nwork appliance and can be used byenterprises or\npnvate-labeled for OEMs. As an appliance, the SSL Inspector is\ndeployed adjacent to existing security and networlung apphnces\nto provide there devices with visibility into SSL flows. The plaintext of SSL flows can be fed to exlsting applications via a de&NETRONOME WHITE PAPER\n\ncated gigabit Ethemet link while non-SSL flows are mirrored to the\nsecurity appliance, firewalled or cut-through, bypassing the security appliance altogether.T h enables SSL visibility to be added to\nexisting network security infrastructurewith no integration effort.\nThe product provides network and security appliance manufacturers with access to plaintext traffic immediately as a two-box solution. The system is configured and managed via a Web-b+ed\ngraphical user interface.\n\nOPERATINGMODES\nIn the network security appliance space, due to its nascent\nnature, the market segmentation is somewhat malleable as the\nmarket is still developing. New threats emerge, security and\ncompliance requirements evolve and enabling technologies\nadapt. This is visible today, considering the numerous categories\nof network and content security appliances available on the\nmarket. Some of the more common products (and product categories) include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, intrusion\nprevention systems, anti-virus scanners, unified threat management systems, network capture, network monitoring, network\nforensics, network analysis, network access control, sparnlsand Web filters. There are also as many analysis techniques employed as there are product categoriesin the content and security\nappliance space. These systems use methods like packet filters,\nsignature detection, traflidpacket anomaly detection, protocol\nmonitoring and packet capture to alleviate security threats.\nEven though the network security appliance market is\ncomplex and constantly changing, these devices share several\ncommon deployment modes. They are either installed in-line\nwith respect to traffic flow, and actively filter traffic to block\nattacks, or they are deployed on a mirrored interface, span port\nor tap port and only monitor network traffic as it passes through\nthe network to identify attacks or record traffic. These device\nconfigurations are referred to in the SSL Inspector as filtering\nand sniffing configurations, respectively.\nThe SSL Inspector is either deployed in-line to offer the\nplaintext of SSL-encrypted communications to sniffing or filtering applications for analysis, or it can be installed in a passive\nor \"offline\" mode for packet capture applications. The choice\nbetween\nmodes\nis a global system setting configured by the\n.\n.\nnetwork administrator.\n\nFigun\n\nNmonome\n\nsSL\n\nExamining SSL-encryptedCommunications\n\n\n\fSniffing//OS In-line Mode\nIn sniffing in-line mode, also known as IDS inline, the SSL\nInspector sits as a \"bump-in-the-wire\" and will receive all\ninbound and outbound traffic to/from the computing resources\nbehind it. The Netronome SSL Inspector forwards all traffic to\nthe egress network port while simultaneously copying both\nnon-SSL flows and decrypted plaintext to an attached sniffing\napplication for examinatiodoggmg.\nSSL plaintext flows may be marked by the SSL Inspector\nwith either a configurable source MAC, VLAN ID or DSCP to\nidentify plaintext decrypted flows from non-SSL flows sent to\nthe attached security appliance. It is assumed that the sniffing\ndevice is monitoring only and, therefore, no data will be\ntransferred from the IDS or sniffing application back to the SSL\nInspector.\nSniffing //OS Passive Mode\nIn passive mode, the SSL Inspector is deployed off a span port,\ntap or mirrored interface where the appliance is receiving a copy\nof all network traffic for classification, flow identification and\ndecryption. Packets are classified and based on policy are\nforwarded to an adjacent packet capture security appliance, such\nas an IDS or network forensics appliance. In passive configuration, no data is ever forwarded back toward the network;\nthe SSL Inspector and adjacent security appliance are capturing\ntraffic for analysis.\nFiltering //PS Mode\nIn filtering mode, both the SSL Inspector and filtering appliance\nare in-line and all network traffic may traverse both devices.\nSimilar to IDS in-he mode, the SSL Inspector will receive inbound traffic and can pass both non-SSL flows and unencrypted\nplaintext to the host applicat~onor adjacent filteringdevice. SSL\nplaintext flows will be marked by the SSL Inspector with either\nsource MAC, DSCP or VLAN ID to distinguish decrypted\nplaintext flows from non-SSL flows sent to the IPS. The filtering\napplicatiodappliancewill parse the plaintext and non-SSL flows\nagainst its signature database to identlfy and counteract threats\nandlor data leakage.\nUnlike sniffing mode, in a filtering configuration, there is\nan active communications path back from the security appliance. For each SSL packet, a plaintext packet will be generated\nand sent to the filtering appliance where it will be bridged and\nsent back. The original encrypted SSL data packets of inspected\nflows will be held back in a queue in the SSL Inspector appliance. If the flow is validated by the security appliance and packets are received back by the Netronome SSL Inspector, the\nreturned plaintext packet will trigger the release of the original\nSSL data packet, which has been re-encrypted, to the egress network interface. Any non-SSL traffic received back from the security appliance is cut-through to the egress port of the SSL\nInspector.\nIf the attached IPS device decides to drop the flow, it will\nsend a TCP RST and/or silently drop all packets of the flow. The\nNetronome SSL Inspector assumes that all buffered flows are\ninvalid until their packet headers are returned from the IPS. After\na timeout period, the buffered flows are discarded under the\nassumption that the security application has blocked them.\n\nNETRONOME WHITE PAPER\n\nSSL POLICIES\nThe main function of the SSL Inspector is to expose the plaintext\nof encrypted flows to thlrd-party security appliances or applications. In addtion to processing SSL traffic, the SSL Inspector can\nact as an intelligent and programmable traffic-capturing and mirroring device, optionally reducing load on the attached security\nappliance and/or replacing costly network switch span ports.\nThere are several policy and filtering stages that control access to\noverall SSL inspection.\nTraffic Diversion Policy\nThe Traffic Diversion Policy (TDP) is a list of global rules in the\nform of 7-tuple IP filters and associated actions. The goal of the\nTCAM-based rules table is to reduce the processing requirements\non the Netronome SSL Inspector system and the associated\nsecurity appliance or application by providing a classification,\nfiltering and fonvard~ngmechanism for flows to be steered to\nthe IPMDS, cut-through to the egress interface or other actions\nto be performed (such as drop). These rules are applied to all\nincoming flows (SSL and non-SSL) via basic 7-tuple classification\nrules that allow the IT administrator to invoke policies, such as\n\"never decrypt traffic from host w.x.yz, or network w.x.O.0.\"\nThe Netronome SSL Inspector system defaults to a single TDP\nwildcard rule that indicates that all packets should be cutthrough and not mirrored at system startup.\nSSL Inspection Policy\nAn integral part of the SSL Inspector is identifying SSL traffic in\norder to separate it from non-SSL traffic. SSL traffic is identified\nbased on content (pre-SSL, SSL Handshake and SSL Data) and\ndoes not rely on it being on port 443. Based on the SSL Inspection Policy, MIC\nis optionally decrypted and forwarded as plaintext to an external IPSADS network appliance. The SSL\nInspection Policy provides the network operator with a quick\nand easy way to alert the SSL Inspector to valid or acceptable\nuses of SSL encryption that should not be decrypted further,\nsuch as personal banking or other online transactions. Once\nidentified,these flows are immediately cut through to the egress\nnetwork interface without further inspection. Indvidual SSL site\nURLs can be specified as exempt and set to be cut through or\nmarked for inspection. The SSL Inspection Policy contains a\ndefault entry for all flows. The default SSL Inspection Policy is\nthat all flows are exempt from further SSL processingldecryption and should be cut-through at system stamp. Adrninistraton must specifically enable SSL inspection.\nSSL Session Log\nThe SSL Inspector Session Log provides a mecharmm for l o ~ n g\nall SSL communications through the system. It contains the\nlearned information that was passively gathered from the flows\nthrough the system. This database is for the network administrator to view details of SSL flows so that certain trends or\npatterns can be identified as data traverses the system. The SSL\nInspector Session Log is a repository where data detailing the\nSSL flows through the system is maintained and can be accessed\nby the network administrator.\nSSL Session Log Classification Fields\n\nThe SSL Session Log contains data from flows that are being\nactively inspected, as well as those that are not. These flows are\nuniquely identified so that the network administrator can\n\nExaminingSSL-encryptedCommunications\n\n\fidentify activity that needs to be inspected. The flow identification is based on classificationof the certificate fingerprint. From\nthe fingerprint, fields of interest are:\nCertificate Subject\nCertificate Issuer\n5-tuple\nFingerprint Hex\nDate\nTime\nFlow Start Time\nFlow End Time\nSSL-Inspect-WOff (status)\nTraffic Mirroring\nIn sniffing mode, inbound traffic has the option of being\nmirrored to the connected security appliance or application.\nTraffic Mirroring is necessary to configure the profile of non-SSL\ntraffic to be forwarded to the security appliance and other\ntraffic that should be cut-through without further examination.\nTraffic Bypass\nIn filtering mode, inbound traffic can be classified and passed\ndirectly from the ingress to egress network-facing interfaces in\nhardware to bypass the filtering appliance entirely for flows not\nrequiring further inspection. Thls bypass mechanism saves\nresources on the filtering appliance. It also allows the security\nappliance to be removed from service or updated without\naffecting network throughput and availability\n\nSSL CONNECTIONESTABLISHMENT\nOftentimes, SSL connections are passively ignored or actively\ndropped by \"bump-in-the-wire\" security appliances. To decrypt\nSSL, the Netronome SSL Inspector sits inline and acts a transparent proxy to SSL flows traversing the system to provide plaintext of encrypted SSL sessions to adjacent security appliances.\nAs previously described, the SSL Inspector Appliance is deployed as a \"bump-in-the-wire\" directly inline with flows to and\nfrom protected computing resources. This transparent proxy\ndoes not require IP interface configurationon the SSL Inspector's\nEthemet interfaces. This allows the original IP address of the\nclient to communicate with the original IP address of the server\nwithout further admmstrative intervention, such as SSL proxy\nconfiguration on clients. The SSL Inspector acts as a \"man in the\nmiddle\" and intercepts SSL sessions as they are establishedlnegotiated between the SSL client and server.\nBy intercepting these sessions, the SSL Inspector transparently establishes two SSL sessions: one between the SSL client\nand the SSL Inspector; and another between the SSL Inspector\nand SSL server.\nEach individual SSL session terminates on the SSL Inspector,\nbut TCP connections are retained end-to-end via TCP splicing.\nThe SSL stream is parsed, terminated, decoded and regenerated\non the other side. The TCP ACK loop continues to operate between the main client and server, not to the SSL Inspection app h c e . Terminating and re-oripting SSL allows the appliance\nto get hold of the plaintext in the encrypted payload whch can\nbe sent to the adjacent security appliance in a valid, regenerated\nS\ncan be made available via an internal\nTCP stream.

Although the u n m d i e d d i g or filtering application d l see the contents of the unencrypted SSL flows, the\ndata remains encrypted on both the connection from the client to\nthe SSL Inspector and from the SSL Inspector to the Web server.\n\nFigure 4.

The server certificate that\nwould be usually stored in the server and transmitted to the client\nas part of the SSL protocol is transparently re-signed by the SSL\nInspector. The name of the server in the certificate remains unchanged, but the signature of the CA belonging to the SSL\nInspector is applied. A key is maintained for the SSL server in\nwhich all of the details are known to the SSL Inspector appliance. The modified certificate is transmitted to the SSL client.\nInstead of the original server key a different key is used between\nthe SSL Inspector and SSL client. Since the private key associated with the modified certificate a known to the Netronome\nSSL Inspector, the whole SSL handshake can proceed successfully If the SSL clients are configured to use the Netronome SSL\nInspector as a trusted Certificate Authority the SSL client dsee\nthe server ceruficate as a valid CA-signed certificate. This process\nis called \"re-signing,\"and allows the Netronome SSL Inspector to\ntransparently intercept SSL communications.\n\nSSL PROXYMODES\nThe Netronome SSL Inspector can work simultaneously in\ntwo modes with respect to SSL certificates and private keys. These\nmodes are called \"server-controlled and \"client-controlled.\"\nThe primary difference between these modes is the location of\nthe SSL Inspector Appliance relating to the SSL clientkrver.\nClient-controlled\nAlso known as \"re-sign mode\" or \"outbound SSL recrypt\" in\nclient-controlled operation, the SSL client and the SSL Inspector\nAppliance are under common administration by an enterprise IT\norganization. The SSL Inspector would be deployed to inspect\noutgoing client traffic to protect confidential information from\nleaking out of the enterprise. In this mode, the SSL Inspector\ndoes not have access to the destination SSL server private key(s).\nInstead, the certificate key that the SSL server would store and\ntransmit to the client as part of the SSL protocol handshake is\nintercepted and transparently re-signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in the SSL Inspector Appliance. The name of the SSL\nserver in the certificate remains unchanged, but the signature of\nthe CA belonging to the SSL Inspector is applied. A key for the\nSSL server is maintained in the SSL Inspector.\nWhen the SSL Inspector intercepts a connection, it presents a \"re-signed server certificate to the SSL client. Provided\nthat the ceruficate issued by the Netronome SSL Inspector is\ninstalled as a trusted root in the SSL client's certificate store, the\nSSL connection proceeds normally. If the certificate was not\nimported by the client, the client browser issues a security\nwindow to the user because the browser does not trust the\ncertificate issuer. The user could accept the security waming\npop-up box in the browser for the SSL connection to proceed.\nThe a h t r a t o r does not need to have access to the server\nprivate key; he only needs to make the modification to the SSL\nclient by installing the CA certificate to be used for re-signing\n(which is a common one-time configuration task for IT organizations). Optionally, a CA certificate that is a subordinate to\nthe Root CA within the enterprise Public Key Infrastructure may\nbe used for re-signing. This enables minimal administration if\nthe Root CA certificate has already been installed in the client\ncertificate store.\nDuring resigning, the SSL Inspector Appliance will only\nmodify the CA that issued the sitek certificate. All other attributes\nNETRONOME WHITE PAPER\n\npresent in the re-signed certificate are retained from the origmal\ncertificate. In the case that a certificate that has expired, or contains a common name that does not match the host to which\nthe certificate was issued, the client will be presented with a\nwarning as though the SSL Inspector Appliance were not in-line.\nServer-controlled\nIn the server-controlled mode, or \"key-known mode,\" the SSL\nserver(s) and the SSL Inspector Appliance are in the same\nadministrative domain. In this mode of operation, the SSL\nInspector can be deployed to protect e-commerce or other SSLserver infrastructure from incoming web threats, as well as protect enterprise resources from threats originating over SSL-based\nVPNs. In server-controlled mode, the SSL-server private key is\ninstalled directly in the SSL Inspector Appliance. This allows\nthe SSL Inspector to participate transparently during SSL session\nestabhhment between the SSL client and the SSL server.\n\nHIGHAVAILABILITY\nIn order to ensure network uptime and allow the SSL Inspector to\nbe installed and removed from the system with minimal network\ndisruption, various forms of hgh availability measures are s u p\nported in the SSL Inspector system. The system supports both\nhardware and software features to reduce network downtime.\nNetwork Interface High Availability\nThe SSL Inspector Appliance was designed to ensure that\norganizations retain network connectivity and guarantee traffic\nflow in failure scenarios, including loss of power to the appliance. Available with both copper- and fiber-based SFPs, the\nSSL Inspector supports a hardware relay-based interface card\nthat can connect ingress and egress ports in case of power loss\nor any other failure of the SSL Inspector. Failure monitoring\nis accomplished by means of an active heartbeat from the\nNFE-i8000 and CPU to the Ethemet relay interface card. If the\nheartbeat packets are no longer received, the Ethemet relay card\nwill revert to one of two modes of operation:\n\"Fail to close\" or \"fail to wire,\" where ingress and egress\nports are connected via mechanical relay when a failure is\ndetected in the SSL Inspector system. This will allow traffic\nto continue flowing and bypass the SSL Inspector Appliance, as well as any connected security appliances. The\nsystem defaults to a \"fail to wire\" configuration.\n\"Fail to open,\" where the ingress and egress ports are no\nlonger connected during a failure. Fail to open is the\npreferred failure mode for highly secure applications that\nwould prefer that no traffic be sent across the network\n(through the SSL Inspector appliance) when the adjacent\napplication is unavailable to manage or inspect traffic.\nSystem High Availability\nNPU-based Bypass\nThe SSL Inspector supports bypass of all traffic received by the\nsystem, based on a Traffic Diversion Policy rule-set that assures\nthat all traffic is cut-through the system and not forwarded to\nthe attached IDS or IPS device entirely. This wd1 allow traffic to\ncontinue flowing in the network in case of a failure in the\nattached security appliances. These pre-defined TDP rules do\nnot protect from a failure in the Netronome SSL Inspector itself,\nbut rather can be quickly applied to the SSL Inspector to keep\ntraffic flowing in case of a failure of an attached security appliance. They also allow changes to be made to an attached\nnetwork security appliance with minimal network disruption.\n\nExamining SSL-encgrpted Communications\n\n\n\fLink State Control\nEthemet link status is a common method used to identify\nnetwork mfrastructure failures from fiber cuts to system hardware or software problems. If Ethemet lmk or \"canier\" is flagged\nas down, the network device connected to the interface reporting the error is unreachable. When an interface's link state\nchanges, it is useful to report these state changes to adjacent\ndevices. Inserting the SSL Inspector into the network architecture as a \"bumpin-the-wire\" allows it to report link failures on\nthe network-connected ports, as well as state changes to and\nfrom the adjacent security appliance (filteringor sniffingmodes).\nThe SSL Inspector supports configurablebehavior to mirror link\nstate between pairs of ports that form a virtual \"bump-in-thewire.\" This enables the system to function in high availability\ndeployment scenarios which rely on detecting the link state to\ndetermine the path through the system.\nThe SSL Inspector allows the administrator to remotely control the link state to force link down or enable auto-detection of\neach GigE interface through the Web UI. In addition to manually\ncontrolling link state through the user interface, the SSL Inspector supports several link state mirroring modes where state on an\ninterface can optionally be indicated on adjacent interfaces.\nLink State Mirroring Modes\nMirroring by Direct Coupling: In direct coupling mode,\nwhen link is lost on one GigE interface, link is immediately\nforced down on the paired GigE interface. Link indication\nwill always mirror the state of the paired interface.\nLatching Mirroring: In latching mode, when link is lost,\nh k is immediately forced down on the paired GigE\ninterface. An adrmnistrator must manually configure the\ninterface to again automaticallysense link.\nMirroring with Hysteresis: to avoid needlessly propagating\na fluctuating link state, when llnk on an interface goes\ndown, the system waits for a configurable time before\nbringing the paired link down. Once the link on an interface\nis restored, the system waits for an additional configurable\ntime before configuring the paired link to automatically\nsense link state again.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nUsmg SSL to encrypt data over a network ensures that the data\nwas only read by its intended recipient and not intercepted\nduring transmission. The SSL protocol is computationally\nintensive, though. Depending on the cipher suite chosen, SSL\ncan slow down a Web server or application substantially\nThe SSL protocol is slow because public key cryptography is\nextremely CPU intensive. The time and number of CPU cycles\nrequired to estabhsh an SSL session and encryptldecrypt data\nare much hgher than similar metrics for symmetricencryption\nand certainly for an unencrypted TCP connection.\nAccordingly in-line SSL decryption is a potential bottleneck\nin network performance. Most SSL proxy devices in the industry only operate at hundreds of Mbps. Consideringthat they are\n\nalmost exclusively deployed in-line on Gigabit Ethemet interfaces, it takes many devices operating in parallel to keep up\nwith network speeds, not to mention the additional hardware\nrequired to optionally load-balance flows across a large number\nof SSL proxies.\nSSL Inspection Performance\nThe Netronome SSL Inspector is the industry's highest performance Transparent SSL proxy, supporting line-rate network\nperformance, scalable flow-based processing, flexible cipher\nsupport and extremely high connection rates; metrics that\nallow the SSL Inspector to be installed in a network without becoming a bottleneck adversely affecting network ~erforrnance.\n\n.....\n-\n\n.:\n\n.;\n\nCONCLUSION\nWith the amount of SSL-encrypted traffic forecasted to continue\nto increase, IT network operators are lookmg for new solutions\nthat satisfy their need for information security for the enterprise\nand individual users, as well as the requirement for corporate\ncompliance, acceptable use policies and government regulations\nfor both security and privacy. The solution must also be provided without impact to network performance, because providing compliance at the expense of throughput is no more\nacceptable than meeting user and application bandwidth requirements whde ignoring security:To date, it has been difficult,\nif not impossible,to satisfy these competing requirements for security performance and control. Thankfully, for enterprise network operators,a next ggneration of high-speed, transparent SSL\nproxies is now poised to deliver it.\nThe Netronome SSL Inspector is the industryS highestperformance SSL proxy qi any type, providing IT administrators\nwith vislb~lityinto the i'ontents of encrypted flows at the\nhighest speeds, largest n~;$ber of flows and highest connection\nrate. Beyond industry-d~finingperformance, the Netronome\nSSL Inspector is unique y bemg the first transparent SSL Proxy\nthat both increases se-unty and significantly minimizes\nldeployment and operatiyn costs by removing costly user and\nnetwork configuration.\n\no 'Intelhgent to the Core\",NetronomeSS1\n\nAll other trademarks are the property of then respective\nowners\n0 2010 Netmnome Systems, Inc All r~ghtsresewed\nSpertficatlonsare subject to change wthout nouce (2-10)\n\n..,.\n\nThroughput........, ......... .; .....C.. ..... . 4 Gbps (line-Fate):\n- -. - ..\nSSLThroughput ..:,........................ .,....,...\n;,...1 Gbps\n.\n.\n. .- . .. ..

NETIMON\n\nIn la*l\n\ninterception focused architectures this product is in the role of LIG (Lawful Interception\n\nGateway). Such as, NETImon is capable of interconnecting the system of the monitoring authority with\nthe telecommunication system and passing on commands and monitoring related information.\n5. SecureGateway\n\nThe product provides aid for enterprises using portable medias (pen-drive, CD, DVD, mobile HDD)\nstrongly. The portable medias could be deeply investigated from security aspects and immunise, even in\nsuch environments where updating of perimeter defense tools is difficult to solve.\n5. OneWayer\n\nThe OneWayer is a security gate - consists of two servers and one rectifier-like module -which allows of\ngranting one-way dataconnection between two networks where the level and regulation of security is\ndifferent. The typical use case is injection of data into a high security leveled network meanwhile\ninformation must not leak from protected network.\nClientele\n\nThe clientele of NETI can be most easily found in two market segments:\nThe players in telecommunications monitoring (national security organizations, ICT service providers and\nthe international vendors of ICT equipment), on one hand\nThe providers of electronic government services and their suppliers (relevant administrative institutions,\nlarge IT companies and system integrators) on the other hand.\nHuman Resources\n\nNETI has an in-house professional staff over 30 employees including IT engineers, application\ndevelopers, and the management. In order to meet various challenges approximately 20 independent\nexperts contribute to our teamwork from time to time. The industry in which we are active has special\nrequirements regarding human resources besides constantly developed high professional qualifications\nand the knowledge of foreign languages.

This\npioneering technology enables any monitoring device to simultaneously monitor a\nfull-duplex link – using only one NIC per device.\n\nTechnical Specifications:\nOperating:\n\nTypically, full-duplex monitoring with a network tap requires two NICs (or a dual channel\nNIC) – one interface for each side of the tapped full-duplex connection. The Port\nAggregator Tap combines and regenerates these streams, sending all aggregated data out\none separate passive monitoring port.\n\nOperating Temperature: 0ºC to 40ºC\n\nFor cases where the NIC’s capacity is exceeded – for instance, if there is a traffic burst,\nand the 100 Mbps NIC is now receiving 140 Mbps of traffic – port buffering is offered as\na key unique feature to help prevent data overload.

It is a versatile component\nof a monitoring access platform (MAP) for\nimproved network visibility and security\nthreat management across the entire\nnetwork.\n\nEfficient Monitoring Access\nToday’s networks are delivering more\nservices and carrying greater amounts of\nmulti-protocol traffic at higher data rates.\nA single set of wires now carries data,\nvoice, and streaming video simultaneously.\nIncreased security threats and tighter\nregulatory compliance requirements further\ncomplicate network operations.\n\ntools to be deployed across a large number\n\nof network links, with remote, centralized\ncontrol of exactly which traffic is directed to\neach tool. Using browser-based or platformbased software with friendly graphical user\ninterfaces, tools are easily and instantly moved\nfrom one link or set of links to another without\nunplugging and plugging cables and physically moving devices. There is no need to wait\nfor a maintenance window or get approvals for\nchanging the network configuration, because\nonce Director is in place, it is completely\ntransparent to the network. Even if power is\nremoved from both of the unit’s redundant\npower supplies, the fully passive design\nensures that in-line network links remain open\nand network traffic keeps flowing.\n\nIndigo™ Management Software\nNet Optics provides a versatile console\nfor managing and monitoring any number\nof Director and other Net Optics devices.\nIts easy-to-use, Windows‑based graphical\nuser interface (System Manager) makes\nconfiguring and monitoring Director simple,\nand password protection ensures security.\n\nMaintaining network security and\nperformance in this environment means\nmonitoring more points in the network, for\nmore detailed information, and for different\ntypes of data. As a result, monitoring tools\nare oversubscribed and multiple groups with\nvarious responsibilities compete for use of\nthe tools and access points.\nDirector answers the need for more efficient\nmonitoring access by enabling a pool of\n\nNet Optics® is a registered trademark of Net Optics, Inc.

A pool of monitoring tool resources with differing functionality\nenables you to consolidate network performance, threat management, and VoIP\nanalysis tasks into one easy to use device.\nInstalling monitoring tools on individual links decreases their reach and your ability\nto easily analyze traffic with differing tools sets. For this reason, the distribution of\nLink Aggregators across the organization ensures that both network and security IT\nstaff can install the tools they need to do their jobs. The SFP based monitor ports\nallow you to use the copper or fiber based monitoring tools of your choice. This\nsimple plug-and-play solution also addresses the fact that many monitoring tools\nonly offer a single channel NIC, limiting full-duplex visibility. Simply connect the tool\nto the Aggregator when and where you need it most. At least one SFP Monitor Port\nKit is required when purchasing the Link Aggregator.\nAll network pairs feature fail-open technology that ensures transparent traffic\ncontinuity even in the event of power loss to the Aggregator.

This access\ninfrastructure has traditionally been composed of a collection of standard\nnetwork elements such as routers, switches, and muxes that are forced\ninto performing specialized monitoring tasks they were not designed for.\nNetQuest's lnterceptor offers a new solution.\n\nINTERCEPTOR A P P R O A C H\nENABLE SELECTIVE.

It offers selective access t o data traffic\non a variety of packet or TDM service networks ranging from high speed\nSONETISDHlEthernet t o low speed T1IE1 and DSO. Using Interceptor,\nEthernet based tools can gain and maintain real-time WAN network\naccess regardless of the WAN interface's data stream speed or i t s framing\nattributes, tributary hierarchy, or protocol transport.\n\nFull IP Access\nTraffic Routing\nMeta-Data T r a n s l a t i o n\nProtocol Translation\nTraffic FilteringAuto-DiscoveryNetwork Access-\n\n0Traditional Solutions\n\n*\n\n\\\nNetQuest lnterceptor\n\nWhile conventional methods of monitoring access perform some of the functions required for full IP data access, only the\nlnterceptor stands on top of the pyramid, where selective access t o any IP or non-IP data at any speed on any transport\ntechnology is possible without prior knowledge of the network provisioning.\n\n\f1\n\nT R A D I T I O N A L ACCESS VERSUS INTERCEPTOR ACCESS\nBEFORE I N T E R C E P T O R\n\nFigure 1 depicts a traditional monitoring access\nconfiguration where a collection of network elements\nand diagnostic equipment from multiple vendors is\nassembled t o access a range of services. Managing\nthese disparate tools quickly becomes a tedious\ntask. Moreover, configuring and maintaining this\ninfrastructure is a time-consuming, manual process\ndue t o sheer number of possible physical and logical\nconnections on a SONETISDH line. Any one line may\ncarry one or more high speed and many low speed\ntributaries. Each of these traffic streams may be\nframed and transported by a number of possible\nframing formats and protocols. The information\nabout the specific stream provisioning is difficult t o\nobtain and is often outdated or wrong due t o the\nfrequent changes in network provisioning and enduser configurations.\nFigure 1. Traditional Access: A Collection of Standard Network Elements\n\nAFTER INTERCEPTOR\n\nThe lnterceptor is specifically designed for selective\nmonitoring access. It consolidates the conventional\naccess functions with advanced auto-discovery and\nfiltering functions in a single, highly integrated\nplatform shown in Figure 2. Its ability t o discover and\nautomatically adjust t o any standard stream speed\nand format makes i t s access functions independent\nfrom network re-provisioning. This, in turn, greatly\nsimplifies the management of the overall system,\nspecifically if it is integrated with the intercept\napplication. Further, it can both translate WAN input\ntraffic t o standard Ethernet output and off-load the\nintercept probe's CPU processing requirements by\nfiltering and pre-processing traffic. These functions\npreserve valuable probe resources and enable it t o be\nmore efficient by processing only the data of interest.\n\nFigure 2. lnterceptor Access: A Single, Comprehensive Monitoring\nAccess Solution Regardless of Network Technology or Speed\n\nCOST SAVINGS REALIZED\nThe lnterceptor costs significantly less than the sum of the various conventional access products it replaces. Besides\ni t s lower acquisition cost and automated discovery process, the lnterceptor delivers the following long term cost of\nownership benefits:\nReduced management costs\nSimpler t o install and less cabling\nLess rack space and power required\nLower long term maintenance costs\n\n\fAUTO-DISCOVERY PROCESS\nThe heart of NetQuest's lnterceptor is i t s ground-breaking Auto-Discovery process. In applications where private line\nor virtual private line services are being delivered, bandwidth allocation and protocol usage can vary greatly because\nthey are determined by the end-user's specific termination equipment. This issue is further complicated by the dynamic\nnature of network provisioning, which can change on a daily or even hourly basis. Auto-Discovery eliminates the need\nfor the test equipment used t o analyze circuit utilization, the ongoing manpower needed t o operate this equipment,\nand the subsequent task of re-provisioning traditional solutions.\n\nFraming &\nPointer Inspection\n\n\n\nData Ftaming\nverifilatian\n\nlnterceptor detects, qualifies, and reports all physical and transmission protocol parameters of all identifiable traffic\nstreams on SONETISDHIPDH lines. It achieves this by automatically analyzing the clear channel or channelized TDM\ndigital signal hierarchy of each stream t o determine the signal speed, framing format, and channelization structure. It\nalso discovers which tributary containers are in use, which tributary streams are aggregated into virtual groups, and\nthe aggregation scheme (GFPI VCATILCAS and IMA). lnterceptor then determines the data framing protocol being\nutilized as, for example, POS, ATM, or HDLC. By further analyzing the framed messages, it also determines the type of\nIP transport protocol such as PPP, Frame Relay, MPLS, cHDLC, PPPoE, etc. In the final step of Auto-Discovery, lnterceptor\npublishes the results t o be utilized by the intercept application or network operator. The entire process runs continually\nin the background t o ensure any changes in usage or service interruptions are detected and critical surveillance is\nmaintained.\n\n0-0-..3-1\n\nEl\n\nNIA\n\nNIA\n\n0...4-0\n\nD50\n\nHDLC\n\nFR\n\n0-1-4 ...\n\nOC3c\n\nGFP\n\nMAC\n\n\nF\n\n\nThe Auto-Discovery process is shown in the diagram above, along with an example of the table of SONETISDHIPDH\nattributes acquired and reported by the Interceptor.\n\n\fD A T A TARGETING\nUsing the results of the Auto Discovery process, intercept applications can target specific data of interest for further\nprocessing and in doing so, preserve their own processing resources for higher level tasks. Selected IP streams are\nextracted, translated into Ethernet frames, and forwarded t o the intercept application. lnterceptor also effectively\nhandles non-IP traffic by first attempting t o identify the contents and then publishing the results. Traffic that could not\nbe processed or identified can be efficiently groomed and redirected t o clear channel or TDM bypass outputs for further\ninvestigation by external systems, ensuring no potentially threatening data is lost.\n\nMANAGEMENT AND CONTROL\nThe NetQuest lnterceptor can be managed locally or remotely using menu-driven screens via Telnet or a serial crafts\nperson port. Both methods provide secure access through SSH and a multi-level password protection system that\nleverages Radius or TACACS+. The lnterceptor has an integral SNMP V1-V3 agent that supports TRAP functionality for\nalarming purposes.\nFor applications where a tight integration between the lnterceptor and the intercept application system is required,\nNetQuest has developed a machine-to-machine interface called GSCP, a proprietary UDP-based control protocol.\nIntegrating GSCP with the intercept application system enables solution providers t o present a unified solution at every\nlevel.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nMODEL\n1-1200\nSystem Bandwidth\nInput Interface Speed\nOptional Automatic Protection\nSwitching (APS)\n# TDM Bypass Outputs\n\nTDM Bypass Interface Speed\n\n1-2400\n\n1.25Gbps\n\n2.5Gbps\n\nOC3lSTM-l, OC12lSTM-4\n\nOC3lSTM-l,OC12lSTM-4, OC481\nSTM-16*\n\nYes (2)\n\nYes (4)\n\n2 SONETISDH\n\n4 SONETISDH\n\nOC3lSTM-1, OC121STM-4\n\nOC3lSTM-l, OC121STM-4\n\n2 SONETISDH\n\n4 SONETISDH\n\nCelllPacket Bypass Interface\nSpeed\n\nOC3lSTM-l,OC121STM-4\n\nOC3lSTM-l, OC121STM-4\n\n# Output Interfaces (Target\nData)\n\n2 X GigE (optionally\nexpandable t o 4 X GigE)\n\nCelllPacket Data Bypass**\n\n4 X GigE (optionally expandable\n\nt o 8 X GigE)\n\n2U rack mount or table top chassis:\n3.5\"H X 19\"W X 17.25\"D\n(8.9cm H X 48.3cm W X 43.8cm D)\n\nSize\n\nWeight\n\n16 pounds (7.27kg)\n\nPower\n\n140 W (1101220 VAC or 48 VDC)\n\nI Operatins Temp\nI Humiditv\n1 Comoliance\nManagement\n\nABOUT UETQUEST\n\nIncludes any-to-any VC-3 level (Broadband) switching, optional\nany-to-any VC-11/12, and optional 64 Kbps timeslot switching\n\nBypass Grooming Level\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n32\" - 122\" F ( 0\" - 50\" C)\n10-90% non-condensinq\nFCC, UL.

While some government leaders and decision-makers are\naware of these threats, there still exists a gross misperception that \"no one can see what we do online.\"\nThe truth is, even simple search engine queries leave digital footprints that can be used by targets for\ncounterintelligencemeasures.\n\nI\n\n. .\n\nExample of\n\ninformation derived from an unprotectdd IP address\n\nWash~ngton,D.-.\nWindows OS Engl~\nIE v6 Browser\n\n-\n\n\n123.45.6.78\nXYZ Agency\nUnprotected IP Address\n\nWebmaster\n\n~~8\n\n--\n\n--\n\nk\n\nAnti-virus and firewalls are commonly used tools to protect\norganizations from \"inbound\" threats, but do nothing to\nprotect government IP addresses during online investigations.\nOrganizations must protect their \"outbound\" traffic (IP\naddresses) to truly secure their online missions. Without this\ncritical security component, they put their operations at risk of\nthe following counteractive measures:\n\nUsing simple web analytics, any adversary can capture IP\naddresses, allowing them to monitor online activities,\naggregate data, and obtain confidential information\nusing reverse engineering techniques. Mtection, deterrence,\nand exploitation of adversary activities is as important in\ncyberspaceas anywhere else.\n\nWebsite Blocking aurd spoofing\n\nWhen you surf the lnternet unprotected,\nyou expose your IP addresses and network\nidentities putting your mission in jeopardy.\n\n-\n\nWhile the& are other r e m m tk8thwk IP\nhave not been mhitected\n\nthey'\n\n\"\n\n,\n\n\fdmernet\n.\"g#<\nOperations Network\n\nd proven non-attribution tools and technologies, allows organizations to hide their true IP identities\nPrcsprietary technologies, high performance access, and hardened networks combine for a\nhe parameters of any mission.\n\nCloud-based Technologies\n\nCover & Backstopping\n\nrrr\n\nBasic Non-Attributinn\n\nLarge-Sc\n\nI\n\nNon-Attribution\n\nHandheld\n\n.Altrihiitinn f n r Analvsl\n\nION's proprietary IONRotator\" technology provides\nrandom, rotating IP addresses and domains that\nare innocuous and untraceable to the user during\nOSlNT gathering and analytic efforts. Organizations\nwill experience seamless online data collection with\ntechnologies that allow them to blend in to the general\nvisitor population of any target website.

ION'S vetted,\nreliable, proven technologies provide\nturnkey information operation tools for the\nmost critical aspects of online missions.\n\nl\n\nScalable, integrated solutions that can operate under the\nhighest security threat models and requirements are vital for\ntrue non-attribution services.\nl\n\nSingle Network Risk\n\n-\n\n1SPs are limited to providing IP space from only within their\nown networks. Solution providers should have the capability\nto acquire network space from many independent lSPs\naround the globe.\n\nAdditional Identification Risks\nSimply hiding your IP address is not enough. To ensure\nContinuous protection, solutions must constantly monitor\nblacklist and blocking sites, provide billions of pages\nof cover traffic, and stay completely up-to-date on the\nalgorithms used for network identification.\n\nBackstopping Penetration Risk\nBudget Risk\nSolutions that provide subscription-based pricing can help\nprotect organizations from cost overmns and unforeseen\nbudgetary impacts.\n\nExtensive, real world operational experience in the selection\n~f appropriate backstopping levels must be provided to\nensure the highest level of security.

From\nlocal police departments dealing with petty\nor semi-serious crimes (e.g. telephone theft\nwith assault, telephone harassment, etc ...) to\nspecialized divisions investigating organized\ncrime or terrorism, all may need to process\nvariable amounts of data. In the most extreme\ncases, they will need to find just a few phone\ncalls out of the mass of data generated in urban\ncenters. When conducted without appropriate\ntools, such searches become extremely costly\nin terms of investigation resources. In some\noccasions however, it is the only hope to\nsolve the case and must therefore be handled\noptimally.\n\nMERCURE makes it possible to analyze\ndata difficult to process in raw form\nThe days of the ruler and marker are gone.\nWhile it is impossible to analyze a printed listing\nof some 100,000 phone calls, this becomes\na mere formality when appropriate computer\napplications are on hand.\nMercure is a software that enables investigators\nto analyze very large volumes of data in a\nstraightforward and intuitive manner. It is the\nresult of an extensive development always\nguided out of concern for performance and\nthoroughness.\nWith Mercure, the amount of data to be\nprocessed is no longer an obstacle.\nMoreover, since investigators are not computer\nspecialists, Mercure has been built around\na simple and ergonomic user interface. Any\nuser with knowledge of office applications will\nbe entirely comfortable with Mercure and do\nnot require any extensive training. Better yet,\nMercure has been designed for progressive\nlearningfrom basic operationsto most advanced\nfeatures.\n\nA high performance tool, adaptable\nto all data volumes, can improve the\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness of the\ninvestigations\n\nOCKHFlm SOLUTIONS\nMercureV2 O 2007-2010\n\n\fFEATURES\n\n,,,\n\nMultiple workspaces allowing investigators to organize\ndata, work on several cases sirnultaneously or organize\n\n\n., .\n\n11HB)\n\n33337166506\n336aY95711\n33672935093\nS621192164\n\nRaDBr)*LWeM..\nCglETfanMelnFU...\n-R.Lc'i)ed..\nIyIMllllr41~-...\nwmmwsimancnr..\n\nnrounu\nssimmr,\n3 3 6 ~ 8 6 s ~\n\nnr~l~tnu\n--\n\na w l\nmuwes\n\n326lC6WL.\n33588719151\n\n~\n\nmmm m\n\nEt+\n\n-32\n\nl\nP\n.\n0\nEt4\n\nmaaK\n\n,\n,\n\nuamnmhnnra..\n--men..\nm4\nraamwsimnear..\n\n\"O\n\nQIUW-~~..\n\n,\n\nIMIQM17lr.b\n\nm M\naxun\n\n...\n\n446336I8%ZeIO\n92601naO2\n336mm6132\n\nWORK FAST\n\nintuitive way.\n\n72\n\nmmrr*PYUPBBT75mB\n\nmaan\n\n1x11\n\nSI'\"abPMS'BIERm7\n\nmaan 31%\nm~:i+\n\numm~~~~eermr\n\nmStW 3?36\nm ~ e\n\nW=-PIIIBtlEm\n\nnh37Nn..\n\nW4\n\n1 (.18amXela..\n\nmm03\n\nMWTWW97ell.b..\nI E B W ~ S l e ~ .W\n..0\n\n...\n\na s a j a & l e ~\n\n~~~~~CPIIIBI-~II\nm m . z M P Y U I ~ m\n\nss4\n\nmbmrdnma*..\n\nLRI:\n\n50lucrdm&PMBaoaC7Bal\nnrrd.thPmJsmm7\n\nmmn\nmmm\n\nS 4\n\n=6U12-=\n\n2x7\n\n-\n\n~\n-oakr9omh..\n\nA~-PIIIBI.BE~IS\nWrrld.PlllCImE7mm\n\n10D16159 6 Z n m P 1 1 1 5 3 B E 7 K o 3\n\nS64\n780\n\nmmmmOa,\n\nmm03\n\nm m\n\nIrrbPIIIB IE+€mll\n29ebPP*UI-ml\nI N ~ ~ L P K U S - ~ S\n\n*mCsaapMSlaarmu\nmslsso r s e n a r r m a e r m\n\n\f+\n\nSuppart Lrge volums of data (millio\nAnalyse data from different sources\n* celldumps (logs on retav stations)\nitemizedbibinga\n* f o r 8 n s I ~ mmory\n~ ~ e extractions (phone directories, SMS and call logs)\ncanparison lind qlieries arnonBdata of any type (cell dumps, billings or extractipns)\nExport any result tabh to office applications (Openoffice or Microsoft Office)\nExport of pll#&g&@ data to other criminal analysis tools\nStorage-@*&W2\ndata and data exchange between MercureV2 servers\nUse g r e ~ % d i c a t e dto phone analysis\n\n--\n\nL\n\na'\naz. 8,\n;\n\nLL\n'\n-\n\n\nL\n\n4'-\n\nW\n\"\n..\n\nr.p\n\"J!'\n\n......r\n....L \"2\"\"\n\n..,...,.

Dans les cas les\nplus extremes, il s'agira de retrouver quelques\nappels parmi la masse de donnees generee\ndans nos centres urbains. Menees sans outil\napproprie, ces recherches sont extremement\ncofiteuses en ressources d'enqugte. Elles\nconstituent pourtant, dans certains cas, le seul\nespoir d'elucider les faits et doivent donc etre\ntraitees de faqon optimale.\n\nMercure est un logiciel permettant aux\nenqueteurs d'analyser de tres grands volumes\nde donnees de facon simple et intuitive. II est\nle fruit d'un long developpement toujours guide\npar un souci de performance et d'exhaustivite.\nLe volume de donnees a analyser n'est plus un\nobstacle.\nDe plus, parce que les enqueteurs ne sont pas\ndes informaticiens, Mercure est c o n y pour etre\nd'une utilisation simple et ergonomique. Tout\nutilisateur sachant manipuler des applications\nbureautiques sera apte a utiliser le logiciel sans\navoir a suivre une longue formation.

I\n\n2010\n\nDEVELOPMENTS\n\nTHE NEWSLETTER FROM PACKET FORENSICS COVERING INDUSTRY AND PRODUCT EVOLUTION\n\nPrivate VoIP Exchanges & the IAX Dilemma\nExplosive Growth of I A X Protocol and International E I P Tmnking Leaves Industry Unprepared\nIn June of 2009, Packet Forensics undertook a\ncomprehensive research effort with the help of one\nof our partners, a global telecommunications service\nprovider. Their network represents a large crosssection of the greater North American IP backbone\nbecause they are a tier1 Internet service provider, or\nto what people commonly refer as a carrier's carrier.\nAmongst a larger agenda, we sought to unearth\nquantitative details related to actual VoIP protocol\nusage-what are people using to transport VoIP\ntraffic and are they trunking to several large carriers\nor is there a preponderance of peertopeer traffic or\ninterconnectivitybetween PBXs and providers.\nWhat we found not only surprised us, but warranted\nimmediate action on our part to fill gaps in our\nproduct portfolio and to inform our current\ncustomers who rely upon us for passive VoIP\nmonitoring and interception.\nIn order to preserve subscriber privacy, deep\npacket inspection (DPI) was used only to positively\nidentify protocols and because of privacy sensitivity,\nwe did not determine if calls were being executed\nindependently or trunked. Trafficflow records were\nanalyzed to identify statistically significant networks\nof call origination and termination and to get a\nsense of which protocols were being used in which\ntelephony situations.\nThe high level results of the analysis provided\nunexpected answers and insight. First, MGCP is still\nused across the public Internet, not only within\nenterprises. Second, H.323 remains the heavy-lifter\nfor teleconferencing. Finally InterAsterisk\nExchange (IAX) protocol now comprises a doubledigit percentage of VoIl? This is particularly\ninteresting when you consider IAX traffic\noccupies only one stream for potentially\ndozens of calls when trunking. Consider\nalso that although IAX is an open\nstandard, the vast majority of telephony\nplatforms implementing IAX are non-\n\nr\n\nMGCP\n\nNorth American Backbone VoIP Protocol Distribution,June 2009\n\ncommercial, public domain applications that don't\ninclude facilities for active interception capability\nThis means L4X ttafficmust be ca~turedbassivel~and\ndoing so requires systems like ours. The speed of\nIAX adoption is nothing short of amazing. IAX is\nvery different from most VoIP protocols, but its\nunique characteristics likely drove its adoption.\nFirst, it's a binary protocol as opposed to text-based.\nSecond, it doesn't use RTP to carry call content.\nInstead, it offers a novel approach that aggregates\ninto one stream making\nboth content and si@g\nit NATfiendl~ and\nmore efficientthan RTP\nwith two thirds less overhead per packet.\nSuffice it to say, much of our engineering time\nlate last year was spent in support of\nVIGCP and IAX development and we're\nproud to say that we're now the first and\nonly passive capture solution for IAX. We\neven support IAX's optional trunking\nconiigurations. It's been a busy quarter around\nhere and a productive one for our customers.\n\n-\n\nPAGE I\n\n\f& PACKET FORENSICS\n\nVOLUME I1\n\nNO.

It easily integrates\ninto new vehicle platforms or can be\nretrofitted with GPS receivers and vehicle\nnavigation systems on existing and legacy\nmilitary fleets.\nManufactured in Canada and\nincorporating Canadian and UK\ntechnology, GAJT only requires Canadian\nand UK export approval, so export to\nauthorized customers is greatly simplified.\n\nProtects Position; Saves Lives\nGAJT's proprietary technology uses a\nconcept similar to that of noise-cancelling\nheadphones; it nulls the jammers that\nare trying to overpower the satellite\nsignals that GPS positioning systems\nuse to compute location. GAJT defeats\njamming thanks to antenna elements\nthat create up to six independent nulls\nin the direction of the jammers, so your\nreceiver is clear to acquire and track the\nGPS signals you need to ensure accurate\nbattlefield position.\n\nWithout GPS anti-jam technology, a\nsimple low power jammer can overpower\nGPS signals over a large area, denying a\nposition solution to the victim receiver.\nGAJT improves the GPS jamming\nimmunity of the connected receiver,\nsignificantly decreasingthe reach of\nthe jammers, ensuring that positioning\ncapabilities are retained during combat,\ntraining or other vehicle based missions.\nSuccessfully tested by the Canadian\nmilitary and at UK MODjamming trials,\nGAJT leverages the proven expertise of\ntwo technology leaders known for their\nproducts' performance and reliability.\nMilitary. personnel\ncan depend on GAJT\n.\nto help maintain situational awareness,\nprotecting soldier's lives and improving\nstrategic battlefield performance.\n\n\"\n\nsystems\n\nI\nm\n\n--\n\nGAJT requires I\nelectronics; only power and\nsingle RF cable required\n\nSignificantly shorter order lead\ntimes than existing anti-jam\nSYStemS~~;r~.\nL\n.\"y--.\n-\n\n\n.\n\n_-_\n\nGPS L 1 and L2.

Cette structure compacte offre des avantages\nde taille en termes de coût du cycle de vie, d’encombrement,\nde consommation électrique, de climatisation, etc.\nIl est possible d’ajouter au système fixe des capteurs à faisceaux étroits supplémentaires (cf. ARGUS) pour détecter des\nfaisceaux étroits hors de portée du système fixe en utilisant\nun réseau étendu (WAN). Cette méthode permet de regrouper\ndes systèmes et d’assurer ainsi une interception continue\nglobale et une restitution du trafic réseau Thuraya.\nLe contrôle et la détection parallèles de tous les canaux\nd’accès aléatoires (RACH) offrent la possibilité d‘identifier\nrapidement les modifications régulières d‘attribution des\n\ncanaux de fréquence dans les différents faisceaux étroits et\nd‘ajuster le réglage des capteurs en conséquence. En outre,\nl’analyse des informations issues des canaux d’accès aléatoires permet de déterminer la position d’un terminal Thuraya\nactif et de la représenter sur une carte. Cette fonctionnalité\nest incluse de série dans la configuration de base.\nL’analyse des données de connexion (Session Related Information) permet de sélectionner des groupes cibles importants\net de soumettre les contenus des trafics correspondants à\nun traitement supplémentaire des données.\nPartie intégrante du système, le composant matériel de\ndécryptage assure le décodage simultané de plus de 200\nconversations concomitantes. Pour analyser les informations collectées, il est possible de raccorder au système un\nnombre illimité d‘ordinateurs de poste de travail via le\nréseau local LAN.\nRDE est en mesure de proposer des installations complètes\nclés en main, travaux de construction, installation, mise en\nservice et formations compris. Il est également possible d’intégrer des composants préexistants au système, par exemple\nl’antenne de bande C, et de conserver le logiciel préalablement utilisé par le client pour le traitement supplémentaire\ndes données.

Thanks\nto the analysis of communication content and networks and\nthe identification of relevant interrelations, military forces and\nintelligence services are able to recognise dangers early and\ntake appropriate action to combat such dangers and fight\ncriminal activity.\n\nThe introduction of satellite communication–which enables\ntelephone calls to be made and data to be exchanged from\nanywhere in the world–has led to a worldwide communication\nrevolution. The resulting communication channels are used\nintensively by persons and organisations that are of interest\nto intelligence services, armed forces and police authorities.\nConsequently, such channels must be subject to analysis\nusing modern detection systems.\nThe possible applications and the rapid increase in users of\nthe Thuraya satellite communication system have made the\nprocurement of suitable reconnaissance equipment essential.\nThe increase in the coverage area as a result of additional\nThuraya satellites has made this need even greater.\n\nAbout Rheinmetall Defence\nRheinmetall Defence is the international leader in the field\nof Thuraya and Inmarsat satellite intelligence and a longstanding partner of military organisation and intelligence\nservices.\nRheinmetall Defence has been developing and delivering\nsystems for the reconnaissance of satellite communication\nconnections since the beginning of 1990. At present, over\n40 tactical and more than 10 strategic intelligence systems\nare in use by our customers around the world.\nRheinmetall Defence is part of the Rheinmetall Group and,\nwith approx. 6,800 employees, has a worldwide turnover of\n€1.4 billion.\n\n\n\fSystem Architecture\nThe Thuraya Interception L-Band System ARGOS consists of\nthe following subsystems:\nAntenna Subsystem:\nRF signal acquisition and down conversion\nSensor Subsystem:\nIF signal digitisation, data demodulation and decoding\nData Processing and Storage Subsystem\n\nTechnical Data (Basic Configuration)\nAntenna Subsystem\nL-Band antenna\n– Flat Panel 90 cm x 90 cm\n– Lightning protection\nDigital down converter (L-Band)\n– 34 MHz Bandwidth\n(max. 1088 Thuraya frequency channels)\n– Automatic Level Control\nTime reference\n– GPS antenna (with lightning protection)\n– NTP Server\nSensor Subsystem\nProgrammable Multi-Channel Receiver\n– Digitisation of all L-Band frequency channels\nSignal Processing Unit\n– Demodulation and decoding of 102 L-Band\nfrequency channels\nData processing and Storage Subsystem\nServer for data processing and intermediate storage\nInterfaces\nLink to the strategic Thuraya Interception System ARES\nPower Supply\n115 – 230 V AC\n50 – 60 Hz\nApprox. 1.5 kW\n\nDimensions\n19“ rack\nHeight 0.8 m\nOptions\nRuggedised version\n– Shock and vibration proof\n– Air-conditioned\nMulti-level filter to reduce the amount\nof data acquired by the system\n– For use of network connections with\nlimited bandwidth\n– To reduce the number of sessions to analyse\nIncrease of the L-Band channel in steps\nof 136 frequency channels per upgrade\n– To monitor additional Thuraya frequency channels\n\nTime reference\nDownconverter L-Band\nBroadband Frontend\n102 L-Band traffic channels\nData/Storage Server\nUninterruptable Power Supply\n\n\n\fARGOS – Maritime\n\nARES – Strategic System\n\nARGOS – Shelter\n\nARGOS – Vehicle Based\n\n\n\fKey Features\nThe modern interception system, ARGOS intercepts calls from\nThuraya L-Band downlink channels in selected, usually remote\nspots, thus increasing the coverage area of the stationary\nARES interception system. Depending on the position of the\nL-Band antenna, up to six adjacent spots in addition to the\ncentre spot, as well as any further spots, can be intercepted.\nARGOS can be used both in combination with the strategic\nARES system or in a standalone mode. On connection to\nARES, information is compressed and forwarded to the stationary system via a WAN link (e.g. VSAT) and compiled into\na complete session with the C-Band data in order, for instance,\nto acquire and evaluate an entire duplex telephone conversation. Should the data link be disconnected, the acquired\ndata is temporarily stored in the integrated storage system and\nthen automatically forwarded to the strategic system once the\nlink has been re-established. Multi-level filters can be used\nto reduce the amount of data forwarded to the strategic\nsystem. ARGOS can operate in standalone mode without\nsupervision. The system does not require its own decryption\nunit.\nTo extend ARGOS into an independent interception system,\na decryption unit and PC workstation can be easily added to\nthe system, thus allowing the reproduction and evaluation of\nthe acquired information on site. The software configuration is\nmodular and ranges from the reproduction of speech, fax\nand data calls, to link analysis, OCR and speech recognition.\n\nThanks to the system’s modular design, several ARGOS spot\nbeam sensors can be connected to the strategic system ARES.\nARGOS can be sized to the amount of Thuraya traffic expected\nin the targeted areas. The basic configuration allows 102\nfrequency channels to be monitored with potentially more\nthan 600 simultaneous telephone conversations. The channel\ncapacity can be increased in steps of 136 frequency channels\nin each case. The use of state-of-the-art DSP and FPGA\ntechnology allows ARGOS to be housed in a spacesaving\nportable 19“ rack. The compact and modular design offers\nmajor advantages in terms of life-cycle-cost, weight, required\nspace and electricity and climatisation, etc..\nDepending on the scenario, ARGOS may be installed as\neither a stationary or mobile system (vehicle, container or\nvessel). Optionally, the system can be equipped with an additional L-Band receiving unit to monitor the satellite uplink\n(mobile to satellite). Then, the equipment can be used as a\nmobile tactical L/L-Band system for the interception and\nlocalisation of Thuraya terminals in the area of operations\n(ARTEMIS system).\nRDE has a proven competence of providing complete turnkey systems including all the corresponding infrastructure,\ninstallation, commissioning and training. Existing components, such as customer-specific analysis software, can be\neasily integrated into the system. RDE offers maintenance\nand support contracts, tailored to customer requirements,\nduring the utilisation phase.\n\n\n\fB006e08.07©Rheinmetall\n\nRheinmetall Defence Electronics GmbH · Brüggeweg 54 · D-28309 Bremen\nTel. +49 421 457-01 · Fax +49 421 457-2900 · www.rheinmetall-defence.com\n\n\f",

    "text": "Artemis\nSystème d’interception\nde bandes L/L Thuraya\n\n\fIntroduction\nDans un monde de crises et de conflits internationaux et\ndans le cadre de la lutte contre le crime et le terrorisme, l’interception et l’analyse des télécommunications par satellite\njouent aujourd’hui un rôle prépondérant. En étudiant les\ncontenus des communications et les réseaux de communication et en analysant les interdépendances significatives,\nles forces militaires et les services de renseignements généraux sont désormais capables d’identifier les dangers de\nmanière précoce et de mettre en oeuvre des mesures visant\nà repousser ces menaces et à lutter contre le crime.\n\nL’avènement de la télécommunication par satellite, permettant de téléphoner et d’échanger des données à partir de\nn’importe quel point du globe, a engendré une véritable\nrévolution mondiale en termes de communication. Les voies\nde communication en résultant sont largement utilisées par\nles personnes et les organisations qui intéressent les services\nde renseignements, les services militaires et de police. Elles\ndoivent par conséquent être analysées au moyen de systèmes\nde détection modernes.\nLes multiples possibilités d’exploitation ainsi que l’accroissement sensible du nombre d’utilisateurs du système de\ntélécommunication par satellite Thuraya ont nécessité le\nrecours à des outils d’interception adaptés. En outre, l’expansion de la zone de couverture, résultant de la mise en\noeuvre de satellites Thuraya supplémentaires, contribue largement à augmenter ce besoin.\n\nÀ propos de Rheinmetall Defence\nRheinmetall Defence est leader au niveau international dans\nle secteur du traitement des données satellite Thuraya et\nInmarsat et partenaire de longue date des organisations\nmilitaires et des services de renseignements généraux.\nDepuis le début de l’année 1990, Rheinmetall Defence développe et commercialise des systèmes dédiés à l’analyse des\nconnexions de télécommunication par satellite. À l’heure\nactuelle, plus de 40 systèmes tactiques et plus de 10 systèmes\nstratégiques de détection sont utilisés par nos clients dans\nle monde entier.\nRheinmetall Defence fait partie du groupe Rheinmetall,\nemploie environ 6.800 personnes et dégage un chiffre\nd’affaires de 1,4 milliards d’euros à l’échelle internationale.\n\n\n\fArchitecture du système\nLe système d’interception de bandes L/L Thuraya se compose\ndes sous-systèmes suivants:\nSous-système d’antenne pour l’acquisition et la conversion par abaissement de fréquence (down conversion)\ndes signaux RF\nSous-système de capteurs pour la numérisation des\nsignaux, la démodulation des données et le décodage\nSous-système de post-traitement et de contrôle pour le\nformatage des données\n\nCaractéristiques techniques (configuration de base)\nSous-système d’antenne\nAntenne de bande L liaison descendante\nAntenne de bande L liaison ascendante\n– Portée d’interception <10 km\n– Gamme dynamique élevée\nConvertisseur-abaisseur de fréquence numérique double\n(bande L)\n– Largeur de bande 34 MHz\n(1.088 canaux de fréquence Thuraya maxi.)\n– Contrôle automatique de niveau\nRéférence temporelle\n– Antenne GPS (avec protection contre la foudre)\n– Serveur NTP\nSous-système de capteurs\nRécepteur programmable multicanaux\n– Numérisation de tous les canaux de fréquence\nde bande L\nUnité de traitement des signaux\n– Démodulation et décodage de 34 canaux de\nfréquence de bande L bidirectionnels\nSous-système de traitement des données et de stockage\nServeur pour le traitement des données et le stockage\nintermédiaire\nInterfaces\nCapacité de stockage externe\nLAN/WAN\nSession standard, fréquence intermédiaire\n\nDimensions\nSupport 19“\nHauteur 0,8 m\nOptions\nModèle trempé\n– Protection contre les chocs et les vibrations\n– Climatisation\nFiltre à plusieurs niveaux pour réduire\nla quantité de données acquises par le système\n– Utilisation des connexions réseau avec largeur de\nbande limitée\n– Réduction du nombre de sessions à analyser\nExtension graduelle des canaux de bande L à hauteur\nde 68 canaux de fréquence par mise à niveau\n– Pour contrôler les canaux de fréquence Thuraya\nsupplémentaires\n\nRéférence temporelle\nConvertisseur-abaisseur de\nfréquence de bande L/L\nFrontal large bande\n102 canaux de trafic de bande L\nServeur de données/de stockage\nSystème d’alimentation sans\ncoupure\n\nAlimentation électrique\n115 – 230 V CA\n50 – 60 Hz\n1,5 kW maxi.\n\n\n\fARES – Systèmes stratégiques\n\nARTEMIS – Système mobile\n\nARTEMIS – Embarqué\n\n\n\fCaractéristiques clés\nRheinmetall Defence a mis au point le système d’interception\nmobile et innovant ARTEMIS de reconnaissance tactique. La\nliaison descendante de bande L et la liaison ascendante de\nbande L peuvent être toutes deux contrôlées. Le déploiement\ndu système au sein de la portée d’interception permet même\nde reconstituer entièrement les conversations, les communications par télécopieur et le trafic de données. La portée\ndu système est de plusieurs kilomètres en fonction des conditions locales. La configuration de base à elle seule permet\nd’intercepter en parallèle et de décoder 272 conversations\nbidirectionnelles et de reconstituer en ligne jusqu’à 10 conversations en simultané. L’interception a lieu automatiquement\nen fonction des critères de filtre sélectionnables et peut être\négalement sauvegardée avec des fonctions d’alarme.\n\nEn fonction des exigences propres à chaque cas individuel,\nle logiciel peut être complété par des outils haute performance\ndestinés au filtrage et à l’analyse immédiats et efficaces.\nSur la base de la structure de système modulaire standard\ndu système d’interception Thuraya de Rheinmetall Defence\nElectronics, ARTEMIS assure également une liaison avec le\nsystème de contrôle stratégique de bande C/L ARES et permet\nainsi également la reconnaissance dans des zones susceptibles d’être invisibles pour le système stratégique. Ceci permet une application flexible, axée sur le site et conforme aux\nexigences, des systèmes d’interception Thuraya utilisés.\n\nL’utilisation des modules de pointe DSP et FPGA permet de\nréaliser un modèle compact, ce qui signifie que le système\nARTEMIS peut être intégré par exemple également dans des\nvéhicules classiques, tels que des véhicules hors route. La\ntransmission en ligne directement au quartier général des\ninformations interceptées est assurée par l’intermédiaire\nd’une liaison VSAT sécurisée.\n\n\n\fB016f10.07©Rheinmetall\n\nRheinmetall Defence Electronics GmbH · Brüggeweg 54 · 28309 Brême · Allemagne\nTél. +49 421 457-01 · Fax +49 421 457-2900 · www.rheinmetall-defence.com\n\n\f",

It implements the fundamental functional capabilities o f 2D\nfrontal face image recognition.\nMFIP has been developed mainly t o evaluate operationally the benefit\nof face recognition solutions.\n\nIts main features are\nLoad and manage a database of up to 350,000 portraits, with an option for\nan extension to 2,000,000 portraits\nSearch one or more images against the portrait database using the Morpho\nface recognition technology\nAcquire face images from files, or using a camera or a scanner\nExtract face images from video files and search them against the database\nExtract faces from images showing multiple people\nCheck the result of face recognition searches and report on the decision\nmade\nManage subsets of the portrait database - called watch lists - to enable\nsearch scope restriction\nThis document is intended for potential users of MFIP; it introduces the\nconcepts of face recognition and describes how MFIP can be deployed and\nused with minimal effort even for users with no or very limited knowledge\nof face recognition.\n\n\fFace recognition concepts\nFace recognition is a recent although reliable technology\nto compare frontal face images, when the face images are\nsharp and not too small (at least 40 pixels between the eyes,\npreferably more). Morpho face recognition can search any kind\nof face images; even poor quality images, however searches are\nmore reliable with good quality data.\nThe main steps of face recognition are listed below for one-tomany comparisons:\nF-1-WImage acquisition can be done from live or file\nsources (e.g. from a camera or a .JPG file), still\nor video images.\nDuring face acquls~t~on,\na unique identifier of\nthe acqu~redimage must be allocated .\n\nThis step aims at finding where the face (or faces)\nis located in the image, and pinpointing the eye\ncentres.\nTemplate Extraction\n\nA template is a representation of the image that\nis suitable for image comparison. A template\nmay represent either visible features of a portrait\n(e.g. nose or eyebrows location), or purely\nmathematical data such as the results of applying\none or more filters to all or part of the image.\n\n\fQuality Control\nAs the image is analysed and the template\ncom~uted,it is possible to determine whether the\ntemplate is reliable or not, and whether the image\nis of high or low quality.\nA low quality score may require that an operator\nmanually confirm the location of some feature on\nthe image: this enhances the overall accuracy of\nthe system.\n\nFurthermore, in case a face image is not properly\noriented (not fully frontal), a tool is provided to\ngenerate a frontal view of the person from the\nexisting image data.\nMatching\nMatching a face template against a collection\nof face templates. Each comparison produces a\nscore: the higher the score, the more likely the two\ncompared faces are similar.\n\n-\n\nMatch results review\n\nmhemk ~\n\n~\n\n\nThe matching system returns a (possibly empty)\ncandidate list, sorted in decreasing scores. If the\n%\ncandidate list is not empty, and if an operator has\nspecified the request for a visual comparison of\ncandidates, the face images matching those of the\ncandidates are retrieved from the database.\nFollowing review, other actions can take place such\nas, for Instance, inserting the portrait that was just\nprocessed along with its template In the database\nor printing a matching report.\n\n\fMFlP architecture and technical\ncharacteristics\nMFlP relies on client-server architecture\nThe server includes database and matching services\nThe clients are running miscellaneous applications to enable the end users\nto perform face recognition tasks. MFlP can support up to eight clients, with\ndeployment restrictions.\n\nYFlP client\n\nI\n\nFigure 1: MFlP log~calarchitecture.\n\nThe applications have the following purpose\nThe Database Creation application reads face images from a directory,\nextracts the corresponding templates, and stores both images an templates\nwithin the database\nThe Quality Control application presents the face images requiring quality\ncontrol to operators, so that they can review the eyes location as necessary\nThe verification application is the main application for operational face\nrecognition. It includes face image acquisition, one-to-one or one-to-many\nsearch requests against the database with review of matching results, and\nvideo analysis\nThe Face DB Administration application includes database content display,\nimport and export capability, and other administration capabilities\nThe Watchlist Administration application takes care of watchlist creation,\nupdates and deletion\nThe Multiportrait application crops face sub images from a picture showing\nmultiple people. It does not directly integrate with the server: it only\ngenerates sub images.\n\n\fTechnically, MFlP requires the following environment\nPlatform:\n\n- For 350,000 faces or less: client, server or standalone configurations are\nbased on 32 bits PC running Windows XP professional SP2\n\n- For more than 350,000 and up to 2,000,000\n\nfaces, it is required to have\na server based on 64 bit PC running Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 standard\n64 bits; clients are 32 bit PC running Windows XP professional SP2\n\nDatabase management: SQL server for workgroup. For very small\nconfigurations of 5000 faces or less, it is possible to use SQL server express\nCompatible image format: jpeg, jpeg 2000, Tiff and bmp\nCompatible video file format: .avi files with mpeg4 or mjpeg codec\nScanner: Fujistu FI-60 or Epson V700\nCamera: Canon Reflex EOS 450D or Canon Reflex EOS 1000D or Canon\nPowershot 5x1 10 IS.\n\n\fLoading the database\nBecause most users of MFlP already have an existing collection of\nfaces images, it is required before MFlP can be used to load all these\nimages into the system.\nLoading means:\nInserting the images into MFIP database\nExtracting a template from each image\nStoring the template into MFIP database and MFIP rnatcher\n\nThe Database Creation application achieves all these tasks.\nIt works as follows:\n\n1 A user opens the Database Creation application from the desktop\n\n2 He or\n\nshe selects one or more directories where the face images to be\ninserted into MFlP are stored\n\n3 He or she starts the loading process\n4 The loading process reads the selected image files one by one, extracts the\nassociated templates, and creates into the database and into the matcher\nthe corresponding entries. Each portrait in the database is identified with\nthe original name of the image file (without its extension)\n\nS A report is generated\n\nA\n\nDuring the operation, a progress bar shows that the application is active\nand how many images have already been processed.\n\n-*-\n\n0\n.\n\nFigure 2:\nthe Database Creation\napplication interface,\nshowing progress during\nloading.\n\n\fgure 3: Quality Control application,\njt of all images with a quality score\n\nelow 200.\n\nIt may happen that some of the images loaded into the database could be\nof low quality and that the face could not be easily located in the image. To\novercome this potential issue, it is necessary to have an operator review the\nface location on low quality images. The \"Quality Control\" application is\navailable to perform this task.\nThe Quality Control application reads the database to find the low quality\nimages, using a quality score computed during template extraction (for\ninstance within the Database Creation application). It displays the list of all\nimages with a quality score below a certain level.\nFrom this list, the operator can select and review any face image, and change\nas necessary the points showing the eyes location. If some image does not\ninclude any face or if it is not suitable for face recognition (e.g. profile view)\nthen the operator can remove it from the database.\n\n\fSearching face images\nThe main puqmw af MFlP is to acquire face images and search them\nagainst the already existing collection of faces. Once searching b\ndone, it is possible to review the pmpased candidate imags, me55\nwhether they really come from the same person a the search image,\nand insert them hto the database.\nAll these tasks are performed using the Verification application that can be\nstarted from the user desktop.\n\nFigure4 Verifmtion\napplication, start xreen.\n\n>\n\nThere are mainly 2 kinds of 2D image searching: 1:l searches (also known as authentication)\nand 1:n searches (also known as ~dentification).The verification application can handle both:\n1:I searches are handled from the rrghtmost buttons of the top tool bar, and l:n searches are\nhandled from the leftmost buttons of the top tool bar.\nTo acquire face images, three means are proposed by MHP:\nAcquisition from a scannec depending on a configuration parameter, MFlP can scan\na picture and look for a face in the scanned image\nAcquisition from a camera: in case of live acquisition, dedicated face acquisrtion software\nis avarlable. It helps the users getting hrgh quality portraits, cropped as recommended in the\nICAO standard, and it displays compliancy status of the acquired and cropped image for all\n/CA0 cr~teria\nAcquisition from files. This acquisition mode is the only one that is compatible with\nbatch operations. the user can select multiple face images (up to 100) to be compared to\nthe database\n\n\f1\n.\n\nl\n\n;\n\nWhatever acquisition means IS used, the\nacqurred images are analysed automatically,\na template is extracted, and a quality mark\nis given. If quality is not high enough,\nthe acquired images must be reviewed to\nperform a qual~tycheck.\n\nFigure 5:Acquisition from files: defining the quality check\nand matching parameters.\n\n\n1I\n\nQuality checking includes:\nThe ability to change eyes location (called\n2DQCl\nThe ability to \"turn the face\" using a 3 D\nmodel, in order to reconstruct a frontal\nview of the searchedperson (called 3D QC)\nOnce the images are corrected, the\nsearches are done automatically.\n\nFi ure 6: Qualitycontrol within the verification application.\n--\n\nIn case on an authentication, the end users\ncan check the result using the following\nscreen:\n\nFigure 7: Authentication verification screen within the\nVerification application.\n\n\fFigure 8: Identification verification screen within the\nVerification application.\n\nFigure 9: Multi Portrait application.\n\nIn case of identification, the user can check\nthe candidates using the following screen.\nIn both cases, tools are provided to make\nimage comparison easier:\nChange the magnification rate\nAdjust image size so that faces are seen at\nthe same scale\nConvert to grey scale\nCreate an horizontal or vertical merge of\nthe search and candidate images\nMake a hit no hit decision\nFollowing a search, a matching report can\nbe printed, and the searched image can be\ninserted into the database.\n\nIn some cases, a single image includes many\nportraits: the Multi Portrait application can\nbe used to find and extract conveniently\nportraits from such images, individually or\nby batch.\nThe Multi Portrait application is started\nfrom the user's desktop. It asks the user\nto select one or more images, and extracts\nall individual portraits it can find on these - images. Whileextraction Brunning, a progre25~\n. .\nbar is displayed.\n-The face images extracted can be displayed\nfor review, and are saved in a directory.\nOnce they have been extracted, they can be\nselected from the Verification application\nfor further processing.\n\n\fSearching face images extracted from\nvideo files\nBecause sometimes fare images could be found in video faotage,\nMFIP includes a video analyser capability. This capabiJQ is available\ninside the Verification application, at the same level as the static file\nsearching capability. Video analysis includes extracting and tracking\nface i m a g barn\n~\na video file, and matching the extraded images\nagainst the database.\nTo trigger the analysis of a video, the user first needs t o select a video file from\na directory. A short wizard enables the operator t o define the face extraction\nand matching parameters.\nThen the video file is analysed, and displayed at the same speed. The face\nimages extracted from the video are displayed t o the user on the right size\nof the screen.\n\nOnce the analysis is completed,\nthe operator can display any subsequence of the video, forward\nand backward, accessed either\nsequentially or directly from any\nextracted face image (access to\nthe first frame in which the person\ncan be seen, or to the last image\non which a person can be seen).\n\nFigure 10: Multi Portrait application.\n\nIt n also possible to select any of the\nextracted face ~mages,and check\nthe corresponding search results\nfor\nThe search result d~splayn s~m~lar\nfaces extracted from vldeos and for\nstatlc face ~mages.Thesamedecls~on\nand tools are available\n\n\fManaging MFlP\nBecause it is necessary to manage the face image database and look\nat its content, MFlP includes the Face DB Administration application.\nIt offers:\nDatabase management functions\nSlmple databasesearchesand display\nof result~ngface images\nFace record deletion and edition\n(associatecomments to face records)\nExport selected portrait identifiers\nin a file\nExport portra~trecords fimage and\ntemplate)\n\nSemier management\nReload the matcher database from\nthe SQL server database to ensure\nsynchronicity\n\nFigure 11: Face DB administration application.\n\nReports generatton\nQuality control statistics\nDatabase face records list\n\nI\n\nStatisticson quality and size of face\nimages\n\nBackup and restore operation are performed using the SQL server interface\ndirectly.\nThe Watch list management application manages sets of portraits that can be\nused to restrict search scope. It includes the following capabilities:\nCreate a watch list\nDelete a watch list\nInsert into a watch list all faces specified by identifier in a file\n\n-\n\nMFlP also includes miscellaneous capabilities such as automatic import from a\ndirectory, and a limited set of web services, mainly des~gnedfor demonstratron\npurpose.\n\n\fSample project description\nBecause MFlP has been specifically designed for technology trials, its\nimplementation is extremely simple.\n\nThe first step is to make a simple project description:\nPurpose of the trial\nSize of the portrait database\nNumber of workstations required\nMorpho will help the potential MFlP user to define the project as necessary.\nWhen the scope of the project is defined, Morpho defines a suitable hardware\nconfiguration and it is agreed between Morpho and the potential customer\nwho will provide the hardware and SOL server. Of course Morpho always\nsupplies the face recognition system itself and its associated services.\nUpon contract signature, a delivery date is agreed. As MFlP is not customizable,\nit can be delivered very shortly after contract signature, as soon as the\nnecessary hardware is available and installed. Because MFlP is so user friendly,\ntraining can be completed in 2 or a maximum of 3 days after installation, if\nthe potential customer wants help with the loading of the initial database.\nIt is recommended to include in the contract a maintenance option, whereby\ntelephone support will be provided during working hours, and fix will be\ndelivered to the customer in the unlikely event of failure.\n\n\f\f9 SAFRAN\nU\n\nI\n\n\f",

Many of these may not have previous been considered.\nThese could include:\nPhysical Security - Are your premises monitored by\nCCTV? Are there door access control mechanisms for\npotentially business sensitive areas? Are physical security\nmeasures circumvented for ease of use? Are your staff\nrequired to display company ID badges? Are unbadged\nvisitors challenged?\nPersonnel Security - Do your employees understand their\nrole in Security? Are new starters subject t o vetting, be\nthat CRB, Credit Checking etc\nProcedural Security - What processes are in place to\nprotect your security interests? Do employees sign and\nunderstand the computer usage policy? What measures\nare in place to monitor access to sensitive information?\nAre passwords changed when a breach is detected?\nBy identifying and considering the impact of vulnerabilities in\nthese areas together the overall impact on security can be\ndetermined, We understand that security is not limited to any\none single element and that cyber assurance should be\nconsidered in a holistic environment.\nHolistic audits begin by engaging with you to determine your\nrequirements and from them derive the best way forward. From\nthis initial discussion we produce a proposal that is submitted to\nyou for approval before the assignment commences. The\nproposal will outline your objectives, the methodology and actions\nto be undertaken by us to assist in meeting these objectives.

Our penetration testing goes one step\nfurther than our vulnerability assessments and will\nhighlight how cyber threats against your\norganisation could be exploited.\nOur penetration tests will demonstrate the real-life\nimplications of potential security vulnerabilities in a\ncontrolled manner. This is applicable both to\ninfrastructure and web applications. A penetration\ntest typically simulates real-life threats posed t o\ninfrastructure or web applications.\n\nBy helping you to understand\nhow cyber threats can\nimpact your organisation we\ncan improve your cyber\nassurance\nwww.thalesgroup.corn\n\n\fHow its done: As an extension of the Vulnerability Assessment,\nPenetration Testing goes one step further than just discovering\nthe vulnerabilities; it seeks to demonstrate what could be\nleveraged by an attacker as a result of missing operating\nsystem patches, mis-configured web servers or web\napplications.\nPreliminary As for Vulnerability Assessments, all engagements\nbegin with a customer meeting to determine the business\ndrivers behind the penetration test. Is a new web application\nabout to be launched do you want to determine whether it is\nsecure or not, or maybe you are seeking to demonstrate your\nnetwork security environment to a potential new client.\nProposal: This clearly identifies the business objectives of the\ntesting, the scope of the testing whether it be the remote\naccess portal, web application, network infrastructure and/or\nbranch office environment, the permissible techniques and\nstrategies for the security consultant to use. It will also provide\nyou with a clear indication of the effort required to complete the\nassignment.\nPenetration Testing: An extension of a basic Vulnerability Testing.\nThe first step of a penetration test is to determine what\nvulnerabilities lie within a particular infrastructure or web\napplication. Systematic testing allows for the easy identification\nof vulnerabilities that may be easily exploited or, yield the\nopportunity when perpatrators are attempting t o compromise a\nnetwork or application. From this, tested vulnerabilities are\ncategorised against criticality and exploitability. Once the\nexploitable vulnerability points of entry are identified the security\nconsultant will attempt to gain access to the system or web\napplication in order to obtain evidence of compromise, this may\nbe the result of a single vulnerability or by multiple\ninterconnected vulnerabilities. This evidence is maintained as\nsubstantiated proof and will be documented in the final report.\nDeliverable: Reports are tailored t o your individual needs which\nwill typically be a final report outlining the findings of the\npenetration test and include which vulnerabilities were identified,\nwhich were found to be exploitable and what evidence of the\nexploit is available. This will provide evidence of which system\nwas compromised, and was retrieved in order to prove that\naccess was obtained. The reports are designed to be relevant\nand readable at all levels from Cl0 to the technical teams\nresponsible for the IT systems. The reports are designed to\nreduce technical jargon to a minimum while maintaining a\nhigh-quality and usable report.\n\nFor more information contact us at:\n\ncyber@uk.thalesgroup.com\n\nThales\nMountbatten House, Basing View, Basingstoke, RG21 4HJ\n\nK\n\n\f@ Cyber Centre\nGlobal Cyber Solutions\n\nl!\n.A\n\nThe modern business environment is reliant upon\ninterconnected networks and communications.\nThis leaves businesses vulnerable to cyber\nattacks, whether this is interception of bank\ntransactions, theft of intellectual property or other\nmalicious and damaging attacks.

Concretement, a travers\nBDSP, Thales federe et modernise les applications de gestion des operations et du\nrenseignement operationnel sur I'ensemble du territoire national, y compris dans les\nDOM COM (Departements et collectivites d'outre mer).\nCe succes demontre la capacite de Thales a fournir des reponses adaptees a\nI'evolution des enjeux et des missions auxquels sont confrontees les forces de\nsecurite. Le Groupe Thales confirme ainsi son leadership dans le domaine des\nsystemes d'inforrnation critiques a destination des forces de securite.\nBDSP permet aux gendarmes, depuis les centres de commandement jusqu'aux patrouilles,\nd'acceder a la synthese de toutes les informations disponibles en lien avec une mission ou\nune intervention. Ainsi les gendarmes disposent de toutes les informations necessaires a\nI'execution de leurs missions, a la securisation des zones d'intervention et a I'optimisation\ndes ressources engagees.\nGr%ce3 la solution BDSP de Thales, I'acces A I'information enrichie se fait aussi bien au\nniveau national qu'au niveau local. A terme, ce sont donc 60 000 gendarmes repartis sur\n4 300 sites qui utiliseront et alimenteront en permanence une base de donnees centrale\ndotee d'un moteur de recherche semantique et d'outils d'analyse et d'exploitation du\nrenseignement operationnel particulierement performants.\nBDSP est un systeme tres performant capable de synthetiser une tres grande quantite\nd'informations et de les restituer en temps reel aux gendarmes afin de faciliter la conduite\ndes operations sur le terrain. explique Pascale Sourisse, SVP de Thales en charge des\nactivites Systemes C41 de Defense et Securite.

    "text": "Utimaco DRS™\nData Retention Suite\nAutomated Data Retention for Telecommunications Service Providers\n\n\fDRS – w orl dw i de\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nData Retention\nData Retention has become a buzzword in intense debates\nbetween data protectors and law makers over the last few\nyears. It refers to the process of storing call detail records\nand subscriber data for various telecommunication services\nfor a period of several months and years. Law enforcement\nagencies and intelligence services regard the access to\nretained telecom data as an important pillar of criminal\ninvestigation and the prevention of terrorism. The common\nobjective is to use the data to identify and trace suspects,\nuncover social networks among terrorists, or to collect\nadmissible evidence for court proceedings.\nMany countries around the world have passed laws that\nstipulate the authority of police and intelligence agencies\nand the responsibility of service providers. In Europe, for\ninstance, the EU directive 2006/24/EC was introduced in\nMarch 2006 as a response to the coordinated terror attacks\nin Madrid 2004 and London 2005. The directive has led to\nharmonized laws within EU member states that oblige telecom operators and Internet service providers to retain call\ndetail records and subscriber data for a period between six\nto twenty-four months, and to respond to inquiries by law\nenforcement agencies without undue delay.\n\nFor telecom operators and ISPs this means they need to\nmake an additional investment in support systems that\nenable them to comply with these new laws. Clearly, it is\nnot sufficient to simply extend the retention period of billing records as the laws and regulations require additional\ndata to be stored, such as unsuccessful calls and e-mail\nrecords. Depending on the size and type of operator there are\nmillions to billions of records to be stored every day and\noperators must be prepared to respond to hundreds to\nthousands of inquiries per day.\nUtimaco has addressed these new needs and challenges\nwith the introduction of a purpose-built solution for telecom\ndata retention: the Utimaco DRS. This system is based on\nthe experience and technology of our world-leading lawful\ninterception system, the Utimaco LIMS, which is deployed\namong telecom operators in more than sixty countries around\nthe world.\n\nChallenges for Operators\nStore millions to billions of records per day of data generated at various sources in the network\nHandle hundreds to thousands of inquiries by law enforcement agencies per day\nRespond without undue delay (near-real-time)\nMaintain high security to protect data\nBe prepared for changes in range of service and network infrastructures\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nUtimaco DRS™\nA carrier-grade data retention solution\nThe Utimaco DRS (Data Retention Suite) has been designed\nas a carrier-grade system to enable fast and secure access\nto retained data by authorized agencies. It enables network\noperators and Internet service providers to easily comply\nwith recent telecom regulations for data retention.\n\napplication. It also provides electronic interfaces to law\nenforcement agencies via fax, e-mail, or IP interfaces\n(ETSI RDHI). The backend components of the Utimaco\nDRS include the DRS Backend Server, one or many DRS\nCollection Devices, and a powerful data warehouse optimized for rapid search and massive data analysis. The DRS\nBackend Server is the core of the entire system as it implements the business logic encapsulated in a well protected\nserver. The DRS Collection Devices provide the service- and\nvendor-specific interfaces to the various network nodes\nthat generate CDR records and keep subscriber and\nlocation data.\n\nSystem architecture\nThe Data Retention Suite consists of a set of software\nmodules that run on broadly-available X64 servers with\nOracle Solaris OS.

The solution supports different methods and data\nformats to access CDRs and subscriber details at various\nsources in the network.\n\nImport to the data warehouse\nCDRs generated by different networks nodes can be loaded\ninto the Utimaco DRS internal data warehouse at a very high\nspeed (up to 100,000 records per second, per server). The\nsystem simultaneously supports multiple CDR sources for\ntele-phony, messaging, e-mail, and Internet Access. Other\nservices can be added on request.\nDuring the data acquisition process all CDRs are\nfiltered, integrated, and normalized to a uniform data format before they are stored in the encrypted database. The\norganization of the data in the DRS data warehouse\ndiffers significantly from common relational databases.\nDRS arranges the data by column rather than by line,\nwhich in effect means that all tables are automatically\nindexed, but without the overhead (storage, management\nand tuning) that is associated with traditional approaches\nto indexing. Columnar storage also means that much more\n\neffective compression algorithms can be applied to the\ndata so that storage requirements are reduced even further.\nAs a result of these and other features, query performance\nwill on average improve by several orders of magnitude\nwhen compared to row-based database solutions.\nThe purpose-built data organization in the Utimaco DRS\nfurther removes the need for a multi-tier archive with\ndifferent partitions for fast access and long-term storage.\nWith the DRS all data records can be kept in one archive\nwhile providing average query times of just a few seconds\neven for complex searches in billions of records.\n\nOnline access to databases\nWhen certain data to be retained are already available in\ndatabases or in information systems of the network operator,\nand can be accessed via common application interfaces,\nthese data do not necessary need to be copied into the DRS\ndata warehouse. Instead the storage system can be configured for online access at query time. This approach saves\nredundant data keeping and reduces costs.\nLaw enforcement agencies can connect to Utimaco DRS\nsystems in various ways depending on the technical capabilities and configurations and on national regulations.\n\nDRS – w orl dw i de\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nThere are handover interfaces for fax, e-mail, and for VPN\nconnections in accordance with the ETSI retained data\nhandover interface (ETSI RDHI).\nThe Utimaco DRS system can be flexibly configured for\ndifferent deployment options and business models. It can\nbe installed and operated by a service provider who exe-\n\nTelecom Service\nProvider\n\ncutes the search requests on behalf of an authorized\nlaw enforcement agency, or, alternatively it can be installed\nat a trusted third party with direct IP connections to the\ndata sources.

Se\nrefiere al proceso de almacenar registros con los detalles de\nlas llamadas y datos de los abonados de diversos servicios\nde telecomunicaciones durante periodos de varios meses\no años. Los organismos de orden público y los servicios de\ninteligencia consideran el acceso a los datos de telecomunicaciones conservados como uno de los pilares de la investigación criminal y la prevención del terrorismo. El objetivo\ncomún es utilizar los datos para identificar y rastrear sospechosos, descubrir redes sociales entre terroristas o recopilar pruebas admisibles para los procedimientos judiciales.\nMuchos países de todo el mundo han aprobado leyes que\nestipulan la autoridad de la policía y las agencias de inteligencia y la responsabilidad de los proveedores de servicios.\nEn Europa, por ejemplo, la directiva 2006/24/CE de la UE\nfue presentada en marzo de 2006 como una respuesta a\nlos ataques terroristas coordinados de Madrid en 2004 y\nLondres en 2005. La directiva ha conducido a la armonización\nde las leyes en los Estados miembros de la UE, que obligan\na los operadores de telecomunicaciones y proveedores de\nservicios de Internet a almacenar registros detallados de las\nllamadas y datos de los abonados durante un periodo de entre seis y veinticuatro meses, y a responder a las peticiones\nde los organismos de orden público sin demoras excesivas.\n\nPara los operadores de telecomunicaciones y los ISP, esto\nsignifica que deben realizar una inversión adicional en sistemas de soporte que les permita cumplir estas nuevas leyes.\nEstá claro que no basta simplemente con ampliar el periodo de retención de los registros de facturación, ya que las\nleyes y regulaciones requieren el almacenamiento de datos\nadicionales, como las llamadas fallidas y los registros del\ncorreo electrónico. En función del tamaño y del tipo del operador, puede haber millones o miles de millones de registros que almacenar cada día, y los operadores deben estar\npreparados para responder a cientos o miles de solicitudes\nde información al día.\nUtimaco se enfrenta a estas nuevas necesidades y desafíos\ncon la introducción de una solución específica para la\nretención de datos de telecomunicaciones: Utimaco DRS. El\nsistema está basado en la experiencia y tecnología de nuestro sistema líder mundial en interceptación legal, Utimaco\nLIMS, que se emplea en operadores de telecomunicaciones\nde más de sesenta países de todo el mundo.\n\nRetos para los operadores\nAlmacenamiento de millones o miles de millones de registros de datos al día, generados por diversas\nfuentes de la red\nGestión de cientos o miles de solicitudes de información al día por parte de los organismos de orden público\nRespuesta sin retrasos excesivos (casi en tiempo real)\nMantenimiento de una alta seguridad para proteger los datos\nEstar preparado para los cambios en la oferta de servicios y en las infraestructuras de redes\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nUtimaco DRS™\nUna solución de retención de datos para operadores\noperadores y administradores mediante una aplicación web\nsegura. También proporciona interfaces electrónicas a los\norganismos de orden público, mediante fax, correo electrónico o interfaces de IP (ETSI RDHI). Los componentes internos de Utimaco DRS incluyen el servidor local DRS,\nuno o varios dispositivos de recopilación DRS y un potente\nsistema de almacenamiento de datos optimizado para\nla búsqueda rápida y el análisis masivo de datos. El servidor local DRS es el núcleo de todo el sistema, ya que\nimplementa el sistema lógico empresarial englobado en un\nservidor muy protegido. Los dispositivos de recopilación\nDRS proporcionan interfaces específicas de servicio y\ndel proveedor a los diversos nodos de red que generan\nregistros CDR y que conservan los datos de los abonados\ny de localización.\n\nUtimaco DRS (del inglés Data Retention Suite, paquete\nde retención de datos) ha sido diseñado como un sistema\npara operadores que permite a los organismos autorizados acceder de forma rápida y segura a los datos almacenados. Permite a los operadores de red y proveedores\nde servicios de Internet cumplir fácilmente las recientes\nregulaciones de las telecomunicaciones concernientes a la\nretención de datos.\n\nArquitectura del sistema\nEl paquete de retención de datos consiste en un conjunto\nde módulos de software que se ejecutan en servidores X64\nde amplia disponibilidad con el sistema operativo Oracle\nSolaris. El componente de entrada, el servidor de gestión\nDRS, permite un acceso sencillo a todas las funciones de\n\nOperación\ny administración\n\nOrganismo\nde orden público\n\nPaquete de retención de datos de Utimaco\n\nhttps\n\nFrontend\n\nServidor de gestión de DRS\nGestión de flujo de trabajo\n\nInterfaz ETSI\n\nServidor web\n\nInterfaz de correo electrónico\n\nMonitor del sistema\n\nInterfaz de fax\n\nServidor backend de DRS\n\nAlmacenamiento\nde datos\n\nOrden judicial, usuario, nota,\nautoridad, gestión del sistema\n\nBackend\n\nMonitor del sistema\n\nIntegración de datos\nProcesamiento\nde consultas\n\nRed de telecomunicaciones\n\nDispositivos de recopilación DRS\nCD 1\n\nCD 2\n\nSistema\nde mediación CDR\n\nRouter\n\nFigura 1: Arquitectura del sistema Utimaco DRS\n\n\n...\n\nCD x\n\nSwitch\n\nArchivo de datos\n\nServidor de\nlocalización\nSystem\n\nBase de\ndatos de\nabonados\n\nHI-A\n\nHI-B\n\nInterfaz\nde transferencia\n\nAnálisis de datos\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nCaracterísticas principales\n• Recopila datos de comunicaciones (CDR, IPDR) y de\nabonados de cualquier red de telecomunicaciones.\n• Conserva grandes volúmenes de datos en un potente\nsistema de almacenamiento seguro de datos.\n• Permite la búsqueda y el análisis muy rápidos de miles\nde millones de registros de datos.\n• Automatiza el procesamiento de solicitudes y envía\nlos datos a los organismos autorizados mediante fax,\ncorreo electrónico o interfaces de IP seguras.\n\nUtimaco DRS se ocupa de todos los aspectos de la\nretención de datos de telecomunicaciones y ha sido\ndiseñado para proporcionar las siguientes ventajas a los\noperadores de redes, proveedores de servicios y organismos\nde orden público:\n\nVentajas\nRentabilidad\nUtimaco DRS minimiza los costes operativos\nmediante la automatización de la gestión de las\nórdenes judiciales y el envío electrónico de los\nresultados de búsqueda.\nLos servidores de amplia disponibilidad proporcionan una relación óptima precio/rendimiento a los\noperadores de telecomunicaciones de cualquier\ntamaño.\nLa compatibilidad con la propiedad compartida\nreduce los gastos para redes de varios proveedores y países y permite modelos de negocio\nexternalizados.\nLa arquitectura de última generación del sistema de\nalmacenamiento de datos comprime todos los datos\nconservados, minimizando los costes de almacenamiento y mejorando el rendimiento de búsqueda.\nCompra integrada: Utimaco proporciona una\nsolución “llave en mano” con todo el hardware,\nel software y los servicios necesarios.\nUtimaco DRS ha sido diseñado para integrarse\nde forma fluida en redes ya existentes, utilizando\nlos sistemas de mediación CDR y las bases de\ndatos de clientes disponibles.\n\nCumplimiento\nUtimaco DRS es una solución específica que reduce el riesgo de incumplimiento de las obligaciones relativas a la retención de datos.\nLos más altos estándares de seguridad garantizan\nla protección de los datos y evitan su uso indebido\npor parte de personas no autorizadas.\nLos flujos de trabajo automatizados ayudan a los\noperadores a mantener el equilibrio entre las leyes\n\nde protección de datos y la obligación de prestar\napoyo a los organismos de orden público.\nUtimaco DRS permite a los operadores manejar\nmiles de solicitudes al día y cumple plenamente los\núltimos estándares ETSI para datos conservados.\n\nFiabilidad\nUtimaco DRS es una inversión a prueba de cambios futuros que se mejora continuamente de acuerdo con los requisitos reguladores más recientes.\nLa arquitectura modular del sistema de software y\nhardware Utimaco DRS facilita los cambios tecnológicos de la red de telecomunicaciones a un coste\nprevisible.\nUtimaco DRS permite la retención completa de\ndatos de telefonía, correo electrónico, acceso por\nInternet y datos de abonados, y puede ampliarse\npara otros servicios de comunicación o para datos\nde otras fuentes como sistemas de transacciones\nfinancieras o sistemas de cuotas.\nLa redundancia de servidores, el almacenamiento\nRAID y el control de los procesos son conceptos\nintegrales para maximizar la disponibilidad de servicio y evitar la pérdida de datos.\nUtimaco DRS es escalable para volúmenes de datos\ndesde algunos millones hasta miles de millones\nde registros de datos y los clientes pueden ampliar\nfácilmente su instalación en función del crecimiento\nde las necesidades de capacidad y rendimiento.\nUtimaco cuenta con más de 16 años de experiencia\nen la interceptación legal y ofrece probadas tecnologías que han sido desarrolladas para el sistema\nde gestión de interceptación legal Utimaco.\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nIntegración fluida en el sistema\nEn lugar de sustituir el equipamiento existente, Utimaco\nDRS ha sido optimizado para una integración fluida en infraestructuras OSS/BSS existentes, reduciendo así el coste total\npara el propietario. La solución es compatible con diferentes\nmétodos y formatos de datos para el acceso a datos de CDR\ny de abonados en diversas fuentes de la red.\n\nImportación al sistema\nde almacenamiento de datos\nLos CDR generados por nodos de redes diferentes pueden\ncargarse en el sistema de almacenamiento de datos interno de Utimaco DRS a una velocidad muy elevada (hasta\n100.000 registros por segundo y por servidor). El sistema es\ncompatible simultáneamente con fuentes múltiples de CDR\nde telefonía, mensajería, correo electrónico y acceso por\nInternet. Es posible añadir otros servicios opcionalmente.\nDurante el proceso de captación de datos, todos los CDR\nson filtrados, integrados y normalizados con un formato\nuniforme de datos antes de ser almacenados en la base\nde datos encriptada. La organización de los datos en el\nsistema de almacenamiento de datos DRS difiere significativamente de las de las bases de datos relacionales\ncomunes. DRS dispone los datos en columnas en lugar de\nen líneas, lo que en la práctica significa que todas las tablas\nse indexan automáticamente, pero sin la cabecera (almacenamiento, gestión y configuración) asociada al enfoque\ntradicional de indexado. El almacenamiento en columnas\ntambién implica algoritmos de compresión mucho más eficientes que pueden aplicarse a los datos, reduciendo aún\n\nmás las necesidades de almacenamiento. Como resultado\nde estas y otras características, el rendimiento de las consultas mejora en promedio en varios órdenes de magnitud comparado con el caso de las soluciones de bases de\ndatos basadas en filas.\nLa organización de datos específica de Utimaco DRS elimina también la necesidad de un archivo de múltiples niveles con diferentes particiones para el acceso rápido y el\nalmacenamiento a largo plazo. Con DRS todos los registros de datos pueden conservarse en un archivo, proporcionando tiempos de consulta medios de solo unos segundos, incluso para búsquedas complejas en miles de\nmillones de registros.\n\nAcceso online a las bases de datos\nCuando determinados datos por retener ya están disponibles en alguna base de datos o sistema de información del\noperador de la red, y puede accederse a ellos a través de\ninterfaces de aplicación comunes, no es necesario copiar\nestos datos en el sistema de almacenamiento DRS. En su\nlugar, el sistema de almacenamiento puede configurarse\npara el acceso online en el momento de la consulta. Este\nenfoque evita el almacenamiento redundante de datos y\nreduce los costes.\nLos organismos de orden público pueden conectarse a los\nsistemas Utimaco DRS de varias formas, dependiendo de\nla capacidad y la configuración técnica y de las regulaciones\nnacionales.\n\nDRS – w orl dw i de\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nExisten interfaces de transferencia para fax, correo electrónico y conexiones VPN, de acuerdo con la interfaz de transferencia de datos retenidos ETSI (ETSI RDHI).\nEl sistema Utimaco DRS puede configurarse de forma\nflexible para diferentes opciones de instalación y modelos empresariales. Puede ser instalado y operado por\nun proveedor de servicios que ejecute las solicitudes\n\nProveedor\nde servicios de telecomunicaciones\n\nde búsqueda en nombre de un organismo autorizado\nresponsable del cumplimiento de la ley o, de forma alternativa, puede ser instalado por un tercero autorizado con\nconexiones IP directas a las fuentes de datos. Un sistema de gestión DRS puede gestionar y segregar muchas\nredes diferentes para permitir modelos de servicio administrados, la compatibilidad con MVNO y soluciones\nDR multinacionales.\n\nPaquete de retención de datos de Utimaco\n\nOrganismo\nde orden público\n\nOrden\njudicial\n\nFunción de\nrecopilación\nde datos\n\nFunción\nde gestión de\nalmacenamiento\nde datos\n\nInterfaces\ninternas\n\nFunción\nde gestión\nde órdenes\njudiciales\n\nInforme\n\nInterfaz\nde transferencia\nAnálisis\nde datos\n\nNodos de red\n\nRecopilación y almacenamiento de datos\n\nGestión de solicitudes\ne informes\n\nFigura 2: Modelo funcional de la retención de datos\n\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nOptimización de los flujos de trabajo\n\nFigura 3:\nCaptura de pantalla de la interfaz de usuario de DRS\n\nLa automatización de los flujos de trabajo, desde la recepción de las solicitudes de datos de los organismos de orden\npúblico hasta el envío de informes, es un concepto integral\nde la solución Utimaco DRS. El sistema puede recibir solicitudes y documentos de órdenes judiciales tanto por fax,\ncorreo electrónico o ETSI RDHI (interfaz de transferencia\nde datos retenidos, por sus siglas en inglés). Las solicitudes\nrecibidas se muestran como órdenes judiciales nuevas en el\nbuzón de entrada de la pantalla del operador. Cuando sea\nposible, los detalles de la solicitud se importarán en el formulario de la orden judicial automáticamente. Tras una breve\nvalidación, la consulta en la base de datos puede comenzar simplemente haciendo clic con el ratón. Los resultados\nestarán disponibles en unos segundos, listos para el envío\nautomático o manual.\nSi las órdenes judiciales se reciben en forma de carta o de\nfax, el operador dispondrá de formularios de informes predefinidos para ayudarle a convertir rápidamente la solicitud\n\n\nen una consulta ejecutable de la base de datos. Los resultados pueden exportarse en diferentes formatos como\narchivos *.pdf o *.csv. El sistema de consultas e informes de\nUtimaco DRS puede ampliarse fácilmente para ser compatible con las demandas específicas de un país o un cliente.\nTodos los flujos de trabajo internos están protegidos por\nvarias medidas de seguridad de última generación para garantizar el cumplimiento de la ley sobre privacidad mediante\ncontrol del acceso, encriptación, verificación de la integridad\ny registros de auditorías completos. El sistema integrado de\ngestión de usuarios permite definir con precisión los permisos de acceso a las diversas funciones y fuentes de datos. Todos los datos del sistema, por ejemplo, CDR, datos\nde abonados, datos de configuración, archivos de registro,\nórdenes judiciales y detalles de las solicitudes, se guardan\nen bases de datos encriptadas. Además, el registro detallado de todos los eventos de usuarios y del sistema previene el uso indebido y permite las auditorías de seguridad.\n\n\fUtimaco DRS™\n\nUtimaco DRS™ – Specifications\nCaracterísticas\nRecopila datos de comunicaciones (CDR, IPDR) y de\nabonados de cualquier red de telecomunicaciones.\nRetiene grandes volúmenes de datos en un potente\nsistema de almacenamiento seguro de datos.\nPermite la búsqueda y el análisis muy rápidos de miles\nde millones de registros de datos.\nAutomatiza el procesamiento de solicitudes y envía\nlos datos a los organismos autorizados mediante fax,\ncorreo electrónico o interfaces de IP seguras.\n\nAspectos destacados\nIntegración fluida\nUtimaco DRS ha sido diseñado para una integración\nfluida en redes existentes de varios proveedores y servicios. La solución puede personalizarse fácilmente\npara comunicarse con sistemas CDR/IPDR, archivos\nde registro, bases de datos de abonados y otros nodos\nde red.\nPropiedad compartida\nUn sistema Utimaco DRS puede ser utilizado para administrar órdenes judiciales y solicitudes de búsqueda\npara varios operadores de red y proveedores de servicio. El sistema granular de gestión de permisos de\nUtimaco DRS puede configurarse para segregar con\nseguridad redes, usuarios y autoridades, y además ser\ncompatible con diversos modelos empresariales como\nmodelos MVNO, servicios administrados o plataformas\nde servicio transfronterizas.\nAlto rendimiento y capacidad\nUtimaco DRS ha sido optimizado para la carga simultánea de volúmenes masivos de datos y el procesamiento rápido de consultas.

Specialized network\nprobes are typically connected to the network by taps,\nthus receiving a copy of the communications traffic. These\nprobes analyze the traffic based on defined filter rules and\ncan extract data of specific interest.\nLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies make use of\npassive probes for non-intrusive surveillance of communication links. Compared to the common approach of active\nmonitoring, where network nodes, e.g. switches or routers,\nacquire the required data, probes have a number of advantages with regard to:\n\nTelecom operators and Internet service providers sometimes prefer network probes for similar reasons. That`s why\nprobes are an integral part of the Utimaco Lawful Interception\nManagement System (Utimaco LIMS™) and of the Utimaco\nData Retention Suite (Utimaco DRS™).\n\nManagement by\nUtimaco LIMS\n\nManagement\nInterface\n\nMediation by\nUtimaco LIMS\n\nOutput\nInterface\n\nPerformance, bandwidth support\nMonitoring Interface\n\nCapacity, number of simultaneous targets/filter rules\nTransparency\nAccuracy, level of details\n\nNetwork\nTap\nNetwork\nLink\n\nUtimaco provides three types of probes:\nLIMS Access Points for IP services\n\nCost-effective probes for single IP services like e-mail,\nVoIP, AAA, SMS, MMS\n\nLIMS Access Points DPI\n\nDeep Packet Inspection Probes for 1Gb to 10Gb\nEthernet networks\n\nLIMS Access Points TDM\n\nProbes for circuit-switched networks based on E1/T1,\nSDH/SONET (STM-1 to STM-4)\n\nLIMS Access Points are centrally controlled by the Utimaco\nLIMS and Utimaco DRS. All data intercepted by the probes\nare encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.\nBefore data is handed over to law enforcement agencies it is\nmediated to comply with international LI standards.\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nDeep Packet Inspection\nDeep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the name of a state-of-theart technology designed to meet some of the key challenges\nrelating to the plethora of IP-based communication services.\nThe ever-growing number of Internet applications and\nIP-based protocols make it hard for law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and communication service providers to identify\n‘bad guys’ or criminals on the net and to analyze their communications for the purpose of criminal investigations and\nprevention of terrorism.\nUtimaco LIMS Access Points implement DPI technology not\nonly to filter individual IP packets but also to decode and\nanalyze complete communications flows of more than\n300 different Internet applications. The probes can either\nextract only the metadata (e.g. source ID, destination ID, IP\naddresses, port numbers, timestamps) or intercept entire\ncommunication sessions. Intercept targets can be identified by a range of application specific user IDs, device IDs,\nnetwork addresses or by keywords.\nUtimaco offers a variety of carrier-grade probes for\ndifferent networks and services. Customers can select\nfrom a range of LIMS Access Points according to their\nactual needs for performance, protocol support and\nscalability.\n\n\nSupported services and protocols\nNetworking protocols\nIPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, Ethernet, EtherIP,\nFTP, HTTP\nTunneling protocols\nMPLS, GRE, L2TP, PPP, PPTP, GTP\nAAA protocols\nRADIUS, DHCP\nE-Mail\nPOP3, SMTP, IMAP, MAPI\nWebmail\nYahoo mail, Microsoft Hotmail, google mail,\nMaktoob, OWA\nVoIP\nSIP, RTP, H.323, SCCP\nSignaling\nSIGTRAN, MTP, MAP, SCCP, RANAP\nand many more Internet applications\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nKeeping Pace with New Types of Traffic\nLIMS Access Points are designed for non-intrusive monitoring without alerting subscribers or disrupting the service.\nThe probes can be seamlessly integrated into networks of\nvarious kinds, such as broadband access networks, IP core\nnetworks, or Internet exchange networks. Common network\naccess techniques such as passive taps (splitters) or switch\nspan ports help ensure that there is no outgoing traffic from\nthe IP probe back to the network.\n\nInternet applications are constantly evolving. Regularly, new\ncommunications applications appear on the Internet and\nestablished application protocols are modified. So customers\nmust be prepared to keep pace with this evolution. To this\nend, Utimaco provides support plans that give customers\naccess to quarterly protocol updates and new protocol plugins. Such plug-ins can also be customized according to\nindividual customer needs.\n\nBroadband Access\nNetwork\nN\nCore Network\n\nExchange Network\n\nPSTN\n\nMobile Access\nNetwork\n\nLIMS Access Points\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nLIMS Access Points DPI\nRealtime Monitoring of IP Networks\nDeep Packet Inspection\n\nLawful Interception and Data Retention\n\nIn contrast to many other network probes, Utimaco LIMS\nAccess Points do not just filter IP packet headers on wellknown ports but reassemble complete IP flows in order to\nanalyze the header fields and the content of more than 300\nIP-based protocols and Internet applications. By carrying out\nsemantic analysis, the LIMS Access Point can track control\nconnections that induce dynamically negotiated connections\non temporary ports such as passive FTP, VoIP or full multimedia conferencing streams, gnutella or BitTorrent peer-topeer traffic and instant messaging, and is able to automatically decode complex encapsulation tunnels.\n\nUtimaco LIMS Access Points are fully integrated in the Utimaco LIMS (Lawful Interception Management System) and\nUtimaco DRS (Data Retention Suite). Intercept targets can\nbe provisioned centrally in LIMS and will then be distributed\nto all connected LIMS Access Points for interception. For\ndata retention purposes the probes can generate IPDRs (IP\ndata records, or metadata) for all IP services or for those of\nspecific interest. These IPDRs are sent to the Utimaco DRS\nfor further processing and storage.\n\nModels\n\nLIMS Access Point for IP services\n4x1Gb Ethernet (copper)\nup to 100kpps\nE-Mail\nAAA\nVoIP\nMobile data\n\nLIMS Access Point DPI 1G\n4x1Gb Ethernet (fiber or copper)\nup to 800kpps\nHW accelerated data aquisition\nMulti-protocol support\n\nLIMS Access Point DPI 10G\nup to 4x10Gb Ethernet (fiber or copper)\nup to 4,000kpps\nHW accelerated data aquisition\nstackable\nMulti-protocol support\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nHigh-Speed Monitoring\n\nInterception of Ongoing Sessions\n\nUtimaco offers a range of probe models to meet customer\nrequirements in terms of performance, capacity, and price.\nThere are small appliances with a 100/1000 Mbit interface and\nsingle protocol support as well as blade-server systems with\nmultiple 10 Gbit interfaces and sufficient capacity to monitor\nmany protocols and thousands of targets simultaneously. All\nmodels are designed to provide line-speed performance with\nzero packet loss. Blade systems can be expanded by means\nof additional line cards and processor cards to accommodate\ngrowing network capacity.\n\nLIMS Access Points keep track of all online users authenticated via the DHCP, RADIUS, or GTP protocol. This feature\nenables intercepts to start immediately, even if a target user\nhas been authenticated before the intercept is activated.\n\nFlexible Target Identification\nLIMS Access Points can identify targets by various kind of\ntriggers related to a certain protocol or service. A target ID\ncan be an IP address, MAC address, user ID, device ID, SIPURL, TEL-URI, email address, URL, MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI,\na keyword, or several other application-level IDs. A virtual\nID manager correlates target IDs of different protocols and\napplications in order to capture all relevant traffic associated\nwith a certain intercept target. For instance, a MAC address\nmonitored in the DHCP traffic can be automatically correlated to the associated IP address to capture all IP traffic,\na SIP-URI can be mapped to an IP address to capture all\nRTP traffic, or an instant messaging login can be mapped\nto the IP address to intercept all IP traffic to and from such\na target. For investigators, this feature represents a great\nnew tool for identifying the communications of a person\nunder surveillance even when the information available for\nidentification is limited.\n\nProtocol Updates\nAs new Internet applications emerge and communication\nprotocols change, network operators must be prepared for\nchanges and updates. Utimaco offers support plans that\ninclude free updates for new versions of protocols at predictable costs.\n\nSecurity & Availability\nUtimaco LIMS Access Points are designed to protect data\nfrom unauthorized access and to provide timely, secure\ndelivery to the law enforcement agencies. Security features\ninclude full audit trails, communication encryption, access\ncontrol, operating system hardening, automatic consistency\nchecks and alarms. The probes are continuously monitored\nby the Utimaco LIMS or Utimaco DRS system and can support redundancy concepts with hot-standby functionality.\n\nCompliance\nUtimaco LIMS mediates and delivers intercepted communications in compliance with ETSI standards, CALEA, and\nother national lawful interception mandates. Utimaco DRS\nretains the data generated by the LIMS Access Points and\nprovides controlled access to such data in accordance with\nnational data protection and data retention laws.\n\nLIMS Access Points\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nMonitoring Telephony Networks\nCircuit-switched connections are still widely deployed in\nmodern telecom networks to carry telephone calls, fax or SMS\nmessages. When monitoring a standard PSTN network or a\n2G or 3G cellular network for interception purposes, passive\nprobes offer a worthwhile alternative to on-switch interception. Probes can either enhance the interception capabilities\n\nBenefits\nHighly scalable\nfrom one to thousands of circuits, up to 100,000\nsimultaneous targets\n100% transparent\nno impact on existing network links\nMass intercept\nmonitors all calls and messages and generates\nCDRs\nStandards-compliant\nETSI conform hand-over via ISDN or IP\n\nLIMS Access Points\n\n\nof switching systems or replace the integrated interception\nfunctionality of switches entirely.\nUtimaco LIMS Access Points can be deployed at various\npositions in a network for monitoring both signaling and\nmedia. The probes associate the signaling to the bearer\ntraffic and then acquire the targeted call data and usage\ninformation. All intercepted data are mediated by the Utimaco LIMS before they are delivered to the law enforcement\nagency over standardized interfaces.\nAlternatively or in addition, the same LIMS Access Points\nused for targeted interception can also generate call detail\nrecords (CDR) for all communications session. The CDRs\ncan be collected by the Utimaco DRS for long-term retention and further analysis.\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nUtimaco LIMS\n\nLaw Enforcement Agency\n\nLIMS Management Server\nHI1\n(target:\nMSISDN,\nIMSI,\nIMEI)\n\nX1\n(target: MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI)\n\nLIMS\nMediation\nDevice\n\nX2\n\nLIMS\nAccess\nPoint TDM\n\nHI2\n\n(IRI)\n\n(DF2:IRI)\n\nX3\n\nHI3\n\n(CC)\n\n(DF3:CC)\n\nMonitoring Center\n\nNodeB\n\nBTS\n\n3G Radio\nAccess Network\n\nIUPS\n\nIUCS\n\nE\n\nA\n\n2G Radio\nAccess Network\n\nGB\n\nGn\n\nMobile\nCore\nNetwork\n\nYu\n\nPSTN/ISDN\n\nGi\n\nInternet\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS Access Points\n\nLIMS Access Points TDM\nRealtime Monitoring of Circuit-Switched Networks\nCommunications Interception and Data Retention\nThe LIMS Access Point TDM supports the interception of\nsignaling, content and location data of telephony calls, SMS\nmessages and faxes on a wide range of networks:\nPSTN\nGSM\nUMTS\nCDMAone, CDMA2000\nThe probes are fully integrated in the Utimaco LIMS and DRS,\nwhere intercepted data is mediated and retained.\n\nTarget Identification\nThe LIMS Access Point is capable of correlating different identities of a single subscriber, even over multiple interfaces. Each\nprobe tracks in realtime all occurrences of MSISDNs, IMSI,\nMSRN, IMEI, and TMSI. This allows the probe to acquire all\ndata related to a target by just defining one of its identities.\n\nContent Analysis\nRealtime monitoring with the LIMS Access Point is not restricted to signaling only. The probe can also detect and extract\nDTMF tones, CAS tones (C5, R2), and fax/modem calls from\nbearer channels.

Most countries have passed laws that\nrequire telecommunication service providers to support\nLEAs with duly authorized requests to identify, monitor, and\ndeliver all of the electronic communications of specified\nindividuals and groups. While regulations and requirements\nvary from country to country, international and US-American\nstandardization bodies like ETSl or ANSl have developed\ntechnical standards for LI that will facilitate the work of LEAs\nand help operators and service providers to minimize their\ncosts. Although various standards for LI use different terminology, the basic functional model shown in figure 1 applies\nto all LI standards and to all network and service types.\n\nThe main functions of any LI solution are to access Interception-Related Information (IRI) and Content of Communication (CC) from the telecommunications network and\nto deliver the information in a standardized format via the\nhandover interface to one or more monitoring centers of\nlaw enforcement agencies. Of course, before surveillance\ncan take place interception requests must be approved\nand appropriately provisioned to the lnterception Access\nPoints within the service provider's network, and they must\nbe carefully and accurately terminated after the interception authorization expires. In addition, high security requirements for LI systems are essential to prevent possible\nmanipulation and misuse.\n\nGeneral LI Architecture (Functional Model)\n\nLawful lnterception\nFunction\n\nLaw E n f o r m m l\n\nInternal lnterception\nCollection Function\nfor IRI and CC\n\nIRI: InterceptionRelated Information\n\nFigure l:Functional model for lawful interception\n\nCC: Content of Communication\n\n\fUtimaco LIMSm\n\nUtimaco LIMSTMA Carrier-Grade LI Solution for Telecommunication\nService Providers\nUtimaco has been in the business of lawful interception\nsince 1994 and has installed LI Management Systems in\nmore than seventy countries around the world. As an active\nmember of the ETSI LI group, Utimaco has participated in\ndeveloping standards and in ETSI Plugtestsl. The Utimaco\nLawful Interception Management System (LIMS) is a\ncomprehensive solution that provides state-of-the-art\nsurveillance capabilities for fixed and mobile communication networks and for various communication services,\nincluding traditional circuit-switched voice, next-generation\npacket-switched networks, 2G13G mobile networks, and\nInternet-based services like e-mail and VolP.\nThe LlMS solution usually acts as a bridge or mediator\nbetween the service provider's network and the LEA'S\nmonitoring centers.\n\nI\n\nThe core competency of the Utimaco LI solution is its\nability to interface with hundreds of different elements in a\nprovider's heterogeneous network and to filter and deliver\ntarget-specific data to the LEA in a standardized format.\nThe LlMS modular architecture provides a future-proof\npath for operators to expand their LI capabilities throughout current and any future networks. The system can be\nconfigured as an entry-level single-server solution for\nthousands of subscribers and is scalable up to a multiserver cluster that enables monitoring in networks with millions of subscribers.\nThe Utimaco LlMS solution, as illustrated in figure 2, consists of the following components:\n\nTelecommunication Service Provider\n\nUtimaco LIMSTM\n\nManagement Sewer\n\nMunitwing Center\n\na -\n\n%.,.,,, -b\",\".\n\nIN1 Internal Network Interface\nIRI. lntercephon Related lnfamahon\nCC Content of Communicatron\n\nX I ,x2, x3\n\nInternal Network Interfaces for L1 Provisron~ng,/RI\nand CC exchange\nHI, H2, H3, Standard handover rnterface to the Law Enforcement\nAgency for L1 Pmvisronrng, /RI and CC exchange\n\nFigure2: Architecture of the Utimaco LlMS\n\n' Plugfests are lntemperabll~tytests organized by the European Telecommun~cattons\nStandards I n s t i i (ETSI) Plugtestm is a trademark of ETSI\n\n\fUtimaco LIMSm\n\nLlMS Management Server\nThe Management Server, the core component of the LlMS\nsystem, incorporatesthe administration system for all system\nmodules, the user interface, as well as security management\nfor the whole system. The server maintains a central database of all intercept targets and authorized LEAs. Once an\nintercept target is entered into the Management Server, it\nis automatically provisioned to the appropriate interception\naccess point in the network.\n\nLlMS Mediation Devices\nThe LlMS Mediation Devices perform all tasks related to\nthe delivery of intercepted communications to the authorized law enforcement agency. Mediation encompasses\nthe conversion and mapping of interception data received\nfrom the internal network to the appropriate formats, protocols and interfaces as required by the LEAs. Also, Intercept Related Information sometimes needs to be stored\nintermediately in the Mediation Device before it can be\nforwarded to its final recipient.\nUtimaco offers the industry's broadest list of mediation\ndevices supporting a wide range of network technologies,\nservices, protocols and standards. There are LlMS Mediation Devices for more than 200 different network elements\nof all major vendors. Delivery of intercepted data is compliant with various national regulations and national and\ninternational standards including CALEA, ATIS, ETSl and\n3GPP standards.\n\nLlMS Access Points\nDepending on the network topology and capabilities,\nUtimaco recommendseither active or passive approaches to\ninterceptingcommunication data. In passive mode, network\nprobes are integrated into the operator's network to filter, decode and forward intercept data to the LIMS, respectively to\nthe appropriate Mediation Device. Utimaco has developed\nspecialized network probes for deep-packet inspection of various communication services and application protocols such\nas e-mail, webmail, lnternet access, instant messaging,Voiceover-IP and other IP-based services. Active interception, on\nthe other hand, refers to the method of managing integrated\ninterception capabilities of the available network elements,\nlike switches or routers. In many real-world deployments a\nmixture of active and passive interception techniques provides the best results or is the only available option.\n\nLlMS Decoder\nThe LlMS Decoder module can be used to enable LI in\nnetworks where the communication session is SSLITLS\nencrypted between the user and the provider's servers.\nIn e-mail environments, for instance, the LlMS Decoder\nis able to decrypt POP3S, SMTPS or IMAPS sessions\nbefore the e-mails can be monitored and filtered by the\nInterceptionAccess Point.\n\nLlMS Gateway\nThis modular media gateway handles the real-time conversion between packet-switched networks and circuitswitched networks. The LlMS Gateway is often needed in\nVolP networks where the handover interface to the LEAs\nrequires conversion of RTP media streams into TDM\nI\n\nI\n\n(Time Division Multiplexing) signals. In addition to the\nmedia conversion, the LlMS Gateway can also act as a signaling gateway between SS7, ISDN and SIP. The product's\nmodular hardware concept enables customized solutions\nfor small networks, as well as for large networks supporting\nfrom 60 to 3,360 simultaneous calls.\n\n\fUtimaco LIMSm\n\nLlMS Hardware\n\nLlMS Remote Provisioning Unit\n\nUtimaco LlMS runs on industry-standard servers by\nOracleBwith Oracle Solaris@operatingsystem. Customers\ncan choose from single-server configurations for small\nnetworks up to multi-server clusters for large networks with\nmillions of subscribers and thousands of intercept targets.\nThe LlMS Gateway is a highly modular blade system with\neight slots for different CPU, DSP and line card modules.\n\nAll administrative and operational functions of the LlMS\nManagement System can be accessed remotely using\nthe same graphical user interface as on the local management console. The LlMS Remote Provisioning Unit (RPU)\nensures that the same security policies apply to both\nremote sessions and to local operation.\n\nLlMS Loadbalancing Option\nLIMS High-Availability Option\nThe high-availability option for LlMS enables operators to\nbuild robust LI systems with 99,999% availability. The advanced Utimaco system monitoring software recognizes all\nkind of potential failures and bottlenecks and automatically\nswitches system processes to hot-standby servers when\nnecessary.\n\nUtimaco LlMS is well prepared to scale with the ever increasing bandwidth requirements in modern telecom networks. Dynamic loadbalancing algorithms distribute intercepted data evenly among a range of mediation devices.\n\n\"S<\n\nR\n\nm X. *\n*&\nari* .l\nmr WTW*\n\n-\n\n*&W\nh*\n\"m\\\"vwC'$mrr%\n\nLT\n\n'I-\n\nePghr*\n\n-m-\n\nworldwide\n\n-.L\n\n\fUtimaco LIMSm\n\n-\n\nUtimaco LIMSTMKey Advantages\ncurity and Reliability\n\nState-of-the-Art Interception System\nAfter over 16 years of experience and continuous improvement, the Utimaco LIMS has matured from a surveillance\nsystem for mobile networks to a complete interception\nsuite for various kinds of networks and services. Today\nUtimaco offers the industry's most comprehensive list of\nsupported vendor network elements and enables lawful\ninterception in virtually any wireless and wireline network\nsupporting multiple services, including telephony, fax, SMS,\nMMS, Push-to-Talk, lnternet access, e-mail, VolP and other\nIP-based services. In its entire software and hardware\narchitecture the Utimaco solution has been designed as a\ncarrier-grade system that meets highest security, reliability\nand performance criteria. The Utimaco LlMS solution is\napproved by national regulatory bodies and is used by more\nthan 150 operators worldwide.\n\nIT security has been Utimaco's core business since its foundation in 1983.A~\nsuch, Utimacothoroughly understandsthe\nsecurity and privacy aspects of lawful interception and has\nimplemented end-to-end security mech-anisms throughout\nthe entire LlMS system.\n\nII\n\nStandards Compliance\nUtirnaco LlMS is designed to comply with national and\ninternational lawful interception standards developed by\nETSI, 3GPP, ATlS and CableLabs. Utirnaco shares its\nexperience and expertise in standards with partners and\ncustomers to continuously optimize the solution and to\nmeet specific requirements according to individual technical and legislative prerequisites.\n\nCost-Eff iciency\nThe Utimaco LlMS is a centralized system that serves all\nLI-related tasks of multiple LEAs on a heterogeneous service network. By using one single point of access, operators can reduce their administration costs by simplifying\nthe communication with LEAs and by reducing the effort\nfor the provisioning of surveillance operations in the network. Operators can initiate, modify or delete any L1 request on the entire network in a matter of minutes with the\neasy-to-use Utimaco LlMS graphical user interface. Once\ninstalled in the network, Utimaco LIMS is almost maintenance-free. Optional system upgrades, for example, for\nnew services or new network equipment, can be provided cost-efficiently by Utimaco as part of a maintenance\nagreement or on an as-needed basis.\n\nThe data security features of LIMSTMinclude:\nAuthentication and authorization by using a\ngranular rights management system that enables\naccurate definition of administrative and operational tasks (role-based access control).\n\n+\n+\n+\n\nI+\n+\n\nFull audit trail with detailed accounting of all user and\nsystem events to avoid misuse and manipulation.\nIntegrated alarm system to alert for system failures.\nRegular consistency checks to guarantee the data\nintegrity in the target database and on the interception access points in the network.\nEncryption of internal and external data traffic.\nEncrypted storage of all sensitive data records,\nand complete removal of user data after expiration\nof the L1 request.\n\n+ Transparent separation of different LEAs and LI\nrequests, and isolated delivery of interception data\nto multiple LEAs.\n\n+\n\nNo back doors: The Utimaco LlMS never permits\naccess to unauthorized users or by means other\nthan those described in the documentation.\nThe Utirnaco LlMS security has been verified by\nofficial regulatory bodies, and interception results\nhave been successfully approved by international\ncourts as admissible evidence.\n\n\fUtirnaw L\n\nModular and Scalable Architecture\n\nManaged LI Services\n\nWhile the system is designed for large-scale networks with\nmillions of subscribers, the LlMS suite can easily be adapted to provide an economically feasible solution for networks with only a few thousand users. In fact, the modular\nsoftware architecture enables operators to extend the systern as the demand for lawful interception increases and1\nor their sub-scriber base grows. Performance-criticaltasks\nand processes can be migrated to dedicated servers to increase the overall system capacity and throughput. The\nunderlying hardware platform, based on Oraclemservers,\nprovides the solid basis for a reliable, scalable system with\nsufficient performance reserves for all current and future\nnetwork sizes.\n\nThe LlMS role-based user management, together with its\ncapability to serve multiple different networks and LEAS\nconcurrently, allows various deployment models of the\nlawful interception system. Operators can either install and\noperate the LlMS system as part of their own Operations\nSupport System (OSS), or they may decide to use the\nservice of an independent LI service provider. Utimaco\nhas selected and qualified a number of LI service providers who can effectively take over all administrative tasks\nrelated to L1 and thus relieve the network operator of unprofitable duties and reduce the costs for maintaining and upgrading systems.\n\nThe modular concept of LlMS further facilitates the integration\nof new network interfaces and protocols without requiring the\nreengineering of the complete system. There is virtually no\nlimit to the number of active and passive InterceptionAccess\nPoints that can be connected and operated in parallel.\n\nGlobal Service and Support\nUtimaco understands that LI management is not simply\nabout purchasing hardware and software - it's about implementing capabilities according to national legal requirements and technical prerequisites. Utimaco provides the\nservices, support and resources that help you become\ncompliant with these requirements while minimizing the\ncosts and effort for installation and operation. With Utimaco's\nhelp, your staff can accomplish lawful interception while\nalso keeping your service network tuned for maximum\nperformance and utilization.

Specialized network\nprobes are typically connected to the network by taps,\nthus receiving a copy of the communications traffic. These\nprobes analyze the traffic based on defined filter rules and\ncan extract data of specific interest.\nLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies make use of\npassive probes for non-intrusive surveillance of communication links. Compared to the common approach of active\nmonitoring, where network nodes, e.g. switches or routers,\nacquire the required data, probes have a number of advantages with regard to:\n\nTelecom operators and lnternet service providers sometimes prefer network probes for similar reasons.

All data intercepted by the probes\nare encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.\nBefore data is handed over to law enforcement agencies it is\nmediated to comply with international LI standards.\n\n\fUtimaco LlMS Access Points\n\nDeep Packet lnspection\nDeep Packet lnspection (DPI) is the name of a state-of-theart technology designed to meet some of the key challenges\nrelating to the plethora of IP-based communication services.\nThe ever-growing number of lnternet applications and\nIP-based protocols make it hard for law enforcement agencies (LEAS)and communication service providers to identify\n'bad guys' or criminals on the net and to analyze their communications for the purpose of criminal investigations and\nprevention of terrorism.\nUtimaco LlMS Access Points implement DPI technology not\nonly to filter individual IP packets but also to decode and\nanalyze complete communications flows of more than\n300 different lnternet applications. The probes can either\nextract only the metadata (e.g. source ID, destination ID, IP\naddresses, port numbers, timestamps) or intercept entire\ncommunication sessions. Intercept targets can be identified by a range of application specific user IDs, device IDs,\nnetwork addresses or by keywords.\nUtimaco offers a variety of carrier-grade probes for\ndifferent networks and services.

Common network\naccess techniques such as passive taps (splitters) or switch\nspan ports help ensure that there is no outgoing traffic from\nthe IP probe back to the network.\n\nlnternet applicationsare constantly evolving. Regularly, new\ncommunications applications appear on the lnternet and\nestablished application protocols are modified. So customers\nmust be prepared to keep pace with this evolution. To this\nend, Utimaco provides support plans that give customers\naccess to quarterly protocol updates and new protocol plugins.

By carrying out\nsemantic analysis, the LlMS Access Point can track control\nconnections that induce dynamically negotiated connections\non temporary ports such as passive FTP, VolP or full multimedia conferencing streams, gnutella or BitTorrent peer-topeer traffic and instant messaging, and is able to automatically decode complex encapsulation tunnels.\n\nUtimaco LlMS Access Points are fully integrated in the Utimaco LlMS (Lawful lnterception Management System) and\nUtimaco DRS (Data Retention Suite). Intercept targets can\nbe provisioned centrally in LlMS and will then be distributed\nto all connected LlMS Access Points for interception. For\ndata retention purposes the probes can generate IPDRs (IP\ndata records, or metadata) for all IP services or for those of\nspecific interest.

Utimaco offers support plans that\ninclude free updates for new versions of protocols at predictable costs.\n\"\n\nLlMS Access Points can identify targets by various kind of\ntriggers related to a certain protocol or service. A target ID\ncan be an IP address, MAC address, user ID, device ID, SIPURL, TEL-URI, email address, URL, MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI,\na keyword, or several other application-level IDs. A virtual\nID manager correlates target IDs of different protocols and\napplications in order to capture all relevant traffic associated\nwith a certain intercept target. For instance, a MAC address\nmonitored in the DHCP traffic can be automatically correlated to the associated IP address to capture all IP traffic,\na SIP-URI can be mapped to an IP address to capture all\nRTP traffic, or an instant messaging login can be mapped\nto the IP address to intercept all IP traffic to and from such\na target. For investigators, this feature represents a great\nnew tool for identifying the communications of a person\nunder surveillance even when the information available for\nidentification is limited.\n\n'\n\nvailability\n\nUtimaco LlMS Access Points are designed to protect data\nfrom unauthorized access and to provide timely, secure\ndelivery to the law enforcement agencies. Security features\ninclude full audit trails, communication encryption, access\ncontrol, operating system hardening, automatic consistency\nchecks and alarms. The probes are continuously monitored\nby the Utimaco LIMS or Utimaco DRS system and can support redundancy concepts with hot-standby functionality.\n\nUtimaco LlMS mediates and delivers intercepted communications in compliance with ETSl standards, CALEA, and\nother national lawful interception mandates. Utimaco DRS\nretains the data generated by the LlMS Access Points and\nprovides controlled access to such data in accordance with\nnational data protection and data retention laws.\n\n\fUtimaco LlMS Access Points\n\nMonitoring Telephony Networks\nCircuit-switched connections are still widely deployed in\nmodern telecom networks to carry telephone calls, fax or SMS\nmessages. When monitoringa standard PSTN network or a\n2G or 3G cellular network for interceptionpurposes, passive\nprobes offer a worthwhile alternative to on-switch interception. Probes can either enhance the interceptioncapabilities\n\n+ Highly scalable\nfrom one to thousands of circuits, up to 100,000\nsimultaneous targets\n\n+ 100% transparent\nno impact on existing network links\n\n+ Mass intercept\nmonitors all calls and messages and generates\nCDRs\n\n+ Standards-compliant\nETSl conform hand-over via ISDN or IP\n\nof switching systems or replace the integrated interception\nfunctionality of switches entirely.\nUtimaco LlMS Access Points can be deployed at various\npositions in a network for monitoring both signaling and\nmedia. The probes associate the signaling to the bearer\ntraffic and then acquire the targeted call data and usage\ninformation. All intercepted data are mediated by the Utimaco LlMS before they are delivered to the law enforcement\nagency over standardized interfaces.\nAlternatively or in addition, the same LlMS Access Points\nused for targeted interception can also generate call detail\nrecords (CDR) for all communications session. The CDRs\ncan be collected by the Utimaco DRS for long-term retention and further analysis.\n\n\fUtimaco LlMS Access Paints\n\nI\n\nUtimaco LlMS\n\nMSISDN.\nIMSI,\nIMEI)\n\nLaw Enforcement Agency\n\nI\n\nI\nL\n\nLlMS\nH12\n(DF2:IRI)\n\nPoint TDM\n\nAccess Network\n\nH13\n\n(DF3 CC)\n\nMonitoring Center\n\nAccess Network\n\n\fUtimaw LlMS Access Points\n\nLlMS Access Points TDM\nRealtime Monitoring of Circuit-Switched Networks\nCommunications Interception and Data Retention\n\nProtocol Supyon\n\nThe LlMS Access Point TDM supports the interception of\nsignaling, content and location data of telephony calls, SMS\nmessages and faxes on a wide range of networks:\n+ PSTN\n+ GSM\n+ UMTS\n+ CDMAone, CDMA2000\nThe probes are fully integrated in the Utimaco LlMS and DRS,\nwhere intercepted data is mediated and retained.\n\n+\n\n+\n\nTarget Identification\n\n+\n\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\nPerformance Figures\n\n+\n\nThe LlMSAccess Point is capable of correlating different identities of a single subscriber, even over multiple interfaces.

It refers to the process of storing call detail records\nand subscriber data for various telecommunication services\nfor a period of several months and years. Law enforcement\nagencies and intelligence services regard the access to\nretained telecom data as an important pillar of criminal\ninvestigation and the prevention of terrorism. The common\nobjective is to use the data to identify and trace suspects,\nuncover social networks among terrorists, or to collect\nadmissible evidence for court proceedings.\nMany countries around the world have passed laws that\nstipulate the authority of police and intelligence agencies\nand the responsibility of service providers. In Europe, for\ninstance, the EU directive 20061241EC was introduced in\nMarch 2006 as a response to the coordinated terror attacks\nin Madrid 2004 and London 2005. The directive has led to\nharmonized laws within EU member states that oblige telecom operators and lnternet service providers to retain call\ndetail records and subscriber data for a period between six\nto twenty-four months, and to respond to inquiries by law\nenforcement agencies without undue delay.\n\nFor telecom operators and lSPs this means they need to\nmake an additional investment in support systems that\nenable them to comply with these new laws. Clearly, it is\nnot sufficient to simply extend the retention period of billing records as the laws and regulations require additional\ndata to be stored, such as unsuccessful calls and e-mail\nrecords. Depending on the size and type of operator there are\nmillions to billions of records to be stored every day and\noperators must be prepared to respond to hundreds to\nthousands of inquiries per day.\nUtimaco has addressed these new needs and challenges\nwith the introduction of a purpose-built solution for telecom\ndata retention: the Utimaco DRS. This system is based on\nthe experience and technology of our world-leading lawful\ninterception system, the Utimaco LIMS, which is deployed\namong telecom operators in more than sixty countries around\nthe world.\n\nChallenges for Operators\n\n+ Store millions to billions of records per day of data generated at various sources in the network\n+ Handle hundreds to thousands of inquiries by law enforcement agencies per day\n\n+ Respond without undue delay (near-real-time)\n+ Maintain high security to protect data\n\n+ Be prepared for changes in range of service and network infrastructures\n\n\fUtimaco DRSTM\n\nUtimaco DRS TM\nA carrier-grade data retention solution\nThe Utimaco DRS (Data Retention Suite) has been designed\nas a carrier-grade system to enable fast and secure access\nto retained data by authorized agencies. It enables network\noperators and lnternet service providers to easily comply\nwith recent telecom regulations for data retention.\n\nSystem architecture\nThe Data Retention Suite consists of a set of software\nmodules that run on broadly-available X64 servers with\nOracle Solaris OS. The frontend component, the DRS\nManagement Server, enables user-friendly access to all\nadministrator and operator functions via a secured web\n\napplication. It also provides electronic interfaces to law\nenforcement agencies via fax, e-mail, or IP interfaces\n(ETSI RDHI). The backend components of the Utimaco\nDRS include the DRS Backend Server, one or many DRS\nCollection Devices, and a powerful data warehouse optimized for rapid search and massive data analysis. The DRS\nBackend Server is the core of the entire system as it implements the business logic encapsulated in a well protected\nserver. The DRS Collection Devices provide the service- and\nvendor-specific interfaces to the various network nodes\nthat generate CDR records and keep subscriber and\nlocation data.\n\nLaw Enforcernenl\nAeency\n\ntimaco Data Retention Suit\n\n.\n.\n.\nHI-B\n\nHandover\nInterface\n\n-3\n\nData Analysis\n\nDRS Collection Devices\n\n\"\n\n-\n\n-\n\nMedlat~on\nCDR\nSystem\n\nFigure 1: Utirnaco DRS System Architecture\n\n\"\n\nI\nRouter\n\nLmtton Subscnber\nSewer\nDatabase\n\n\fUtimaco DRSm\n\nKey\n\n~tures\n\nCollects communications data (CDR, IPDR) and subscriber data from any telecommunications network\n* Retains large amounts of data in a powerful and secure\ndata warehouse\nProvides very fast search and analytics in billions of\ndata records\nAutomates request processing and delivers data to\nauthorized agencies by fax, e-mail, or secure IP interfaces\n\nCost-ef.\n\nI\n\n+ The Utimaco DRS minimizes operational costs by\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n+\n\nautomating warrant management and electronic\ndelivery of search results.\nBroadly-availableservers deliver optimum priceperformance ratio for telecom operators of any\nsize.\nMulti-tenancy support reduces capital expenses\nfor multi-provider and multi-country networks and\nenables outsourced business models.\nThe state-of-the-art data warehouse architecture\ncompresses all retained data and thus minimizes\nstorage costs and enhances search performance.\nOne-stop shopping - Utimaco delivers a full turnkey solution with all required hardware, software\nand services.\nThe Utimaco DRS has been designed for seamless\nintegration into existing networks, making use of\navailable CDR mediation systems and customer\ndatabases.\n\n4 The Utimaco DRS is a purpose-built solution that\nreduces the risk of non-compliance to data retention obligations.\nHighest security standards guarantee data protection and prevent misuse by unauthorized persons.\nAutomated workflows help operators balance between data protection laws and obligations to support LEAS.\n\n+\n\n+\n\nThe Utimaco DRS addresses all aspects of telecom data\nretention and has been designed to provide the following\nbenefits to network operators, service providers, and law\nenforcement agencies:\n\n4 The Utimaco DRS enables operators to handle\nthousands of requests per day and is fully compliant with the latest ETSl standards for retained data.\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n-he Utimaco DRS is a future-proof investment that\nis continuously being improved in accordance with\nthe latest regulatory requirements.\nThe modular architecture of the Utimaco DRS's\nsoftware and hardware system facilitates technology changes in the telecom network at predictable\ncosts.\nThe Utimaco DRS enables full retention of telephony, e-mail, lnternet access, and subscriber data\nand can be extended for other communication\nservices or by data from other sources, such as\nfinancial transaction systems or toll systems.\nServer redundancy, RAID storage, and process\nmonitoring are integral concepts to maximize\nservice availability and to prevent data loss.\nThe Utimaco DRS can scale with data volumes\nfrom a few million to billions of data records and\ncustomers can easily extend their installation as\ncapacity and performance needs grow.\nUtimaco has over 16 years of experience in lawful\ninterception and has proven technologies that\nhave been developed for the Utimaco Lawful Interception Management System.\n\n\fUtimaco DRSTM\n\nSeamless System Integration\nRather than replacing existing equipment, the Utimaco DRS\nhas been optimized for seamless integration into existing\nOSSIBSS infrastructures,thereby reducing total cost of ownership. The solution supports different methods and data\nformats to access CDRs and subscriber details at various\nsources in the network.\n\nImport to the data warehouse\nCDRs generated by different networks nodes can be loaded\ninto the Utimaco DRS internal data warehouse at a very high\nspeed (up to 100,000 records per second, per server). The\nsystem simultaneously supports multiple CDR sources for\ntele-phony, messaging, e-mail, and lnternet Access. Other\nservices can be added on request.\nDuring the data acquisition process all CDRs are\nfiltered, integrated, and normalized to a uniform data format before they are stored in the encrypted database. The\norganization of the data in the DRS data warehouse\ndiffers significantly from common relational databases.\nDRS arranges the data by column rather than by line,\nwhich in effect means that all tables are automatically\nindexed, but without the overhead (storage, management\nand tuning) that is associated with traditional approaches\nto indexing. Columnar storage also means that much more\n\neffective compression algorithms can be applied to the\ndata so that storage requirementsare reduced even further.\nAs a result of these and other features, query performance\nwill on average improve by several orders of magnitude\nwhen compared to row-based database solutions.\nThe purpose-built data organization in the Utimaco DRS\nfurther removes the need for a multi-tier archive with\ndifferent partitions for fast access and long-term storage.\nWith the DRS all data records can be kept in one archive\nwhile providing average query times of just a few seconds\neven for complex searches in billions of records.\n\nbnline access to databases\nWhen certain data to be retained are already available in\ndatabases or in informationsystems of the network operator,\nand can be accessed via common application interfaces,\nthese data do not necessary need to be copied into the DRS\ndata warehouse. Instead the storage system can be configured for online access at query time. This approach saves\nredundant data keeping and reduces costs.\nLaw enforcement agencies can connect to Utimaco DRS\nsystems in various ways depending on the technical capabilities and configurations and on national regulations.\n\n\fUtimaco DRSm\n\nThere are handover interfaces for fax, e-mail, and for VPN\nconnections in accordance with the ETSI retained data\nhandover interface (ETSI RDHI).\nThe Utimaco DRS system can be flexibly configured for\ndifferent deployment options and business models. It can\nbe installed and operated by a service provider who exe-\n\nTelecam Sew~ce\nPlovtder\n\ncutes the search requests on behalf of an authorized\nlaw enforcement agency, or, alternatively it can be installed\nat a trusted third party with direct IP connections to the\ndata sources. One DRS management system can administer and segregate many different networks to enable\nmanaged service models, support MVNOs, and multinational DR solutions.\n\nLaw Enforcement\nAgency\n\nUtimaco Data Retention Suite\n\nData\nCollection\nFunction\n\n1 1\nData Storage\nManagement\nFunction\n\nWarrant\nManagement\nFunction\n\nWarrant\n\n+\nReport\n\nHandover\nInterface\n\nInternal\nInterfaces\n\nI\nL\n\nI\nData Analys~s\n\nNetwork Nodes\n\nData Collection\n& Storage\n\nFigure 2: Data Retention Functional Model\n\nU\n\nRequest Management\n& Reporting\n\n\fOptimizing Workflows\n\nAutomation of workflows from the receipt of data requests\nfrom law enforcement agencies to the delivery of reports\nis an integral concept of the Utimaco DRS solution. The\nsystem can receive requests and warrant documents either\nby fax, e-mail, or ETSl RDHl (Retained Data Handover\nInterface). An incoming request will appear as a new warrant in the inbox of the operator screen. Where possible,\nall request details are imported in the warrant form automatically. After a short validation the database query can\nbe started with just a few mouse clicks. The results will be\navailable within seconds, ready for automatic or manual\ndelivery.\nIf warrants come in as a letter or fax, pre-defined report\nforms assist operators to quickly translate the request into\nexecutable database queries. The results can be exported in different formats like *.pdf or *.csv tiles. The query\nand reporting system of the Utimaco DRS can be easily\nextended to support country or customer specific\ndemands.\n\nAll internal workflows are protected by a number of state-ofthe-art security measures to assure compliance to privacy\nlaws by means of access control, encryption, integrity checks,\nand full audit trails. The integrated user management\nsystem allows for fine-grained definition of access rights\nto various functions and data sources. All system data,\ni.e. CDRs, subscriber data, configuration data, log files,\nwarrants and request details, are kept in encrypted databases.

Today, most fixed and mobile network operators and\ntelecommunication service providers have installed systems to enable lawful interception\n(LI) for the various voice and data services they offer to their customers. Comprehensive\nnational laws have been established enabling LEAs to engage communications service\nproviders (CSPs) to arrange electronic surveillance of specific individuals (also referred\nto as targets). In reality, however, the range of different networks, services, and\ninterception systems together with the increasing number of intercepts pose considerable\nchallenges for LEAs and monitoring centers. In practice, the sheer complexity of lawful\ninterception in such a heterogeneous and dispersed LI environment inevitably leads to\nerrors and delays during the activation of LI decisions or in the collection of interception\ndata. Furthermore, authorities require an immediate overview of all active intercepts to\nfacilitate analysis and statistics of nationwide LI activity.\n\nUtimaco LIMS\nTechpaper Umbrella Systems\n25. Aug 2010\n\n© Copyright Utimaco Safeware AG\n\n3 of 8\n\n\fTM\n\nUtimaco LIMS\n\n\nUmbrella Systems\n\nUtimaco has addressed these needs and challenges by developing an umbrella\nmanagement system that is capable of interconnecting various LI management systems\nvia an automated HI1 interface (see also ETSI TS 101 671 for a definition of HI1-HI3\ninterfaces). As shown in figure 1), the umbrella LIMS is a single interface and\nmanagement platform for all monitoring centers. Intercept targets entered at the umbrella\nsystem are provisioned to the various operator LI systems. Delivery of communications\ncontent (CC) is effected directly between the mediation devices or interception access\npoints of the operator’s network and the collection devices of the monitoring center.\nIntercept related information (IRI) is first handed over to one mediation device per service\nprovider participating in the umbrella system. This guarantees that all IRI is logged,\ntagged and delivered to the appropriate monitoring center in a standardized format that\nenables the monitoring center to correlate CC and IRI with the original intercept.\n\nFigure 1 : Architecture of the Umbrella LI System\n\nUtimaco LIMS\nTechpaper Umbrella Systems\n25.

There is no delay due to paper\nfax or manual configurations on several systems.\nCentral database: The central storage and maintenance of all intercept targets\nenables full control of all active interception requests. It facilitates security audits\nand consistency checks, and allows detailed statistics and instant failure\nrecognition.\nTransparency: Administration and delivery channels between the connected\nservice provider systems are strictly segregated. This ensures that operator\nnetwork personnel have no access to any details of interception decisions in other\nnetworks.\nNo performance loss: Although the administration function is centralized,\ndelivery of intercept data is effected directly from the distributed mediation devices\n(DF2) and network elements to the monitoring center.\nReliability: The central management of all LI systems enhances the reliability of\nthe entire LI network. System failures can be detected automatically by alarm\nmessages so that operators can immediately take appropriate action or require the\nadministrator of the faulty network to analyze the problem locally. To further\nenhance the availability of the system, a redundant management server can be\noperated in hot standby mode. Should local failure recovery fail, the system can\ninstantly switch to the standby server. Automation of the provisioning process\nfurther reduces the risk of human error.\nCost reduction: Automation of the provisioning interfaces (HI1) leads to an\nacceleration of processes and thus reduces the costs of operation for both the\nLEA and the service provider.\n\nUtimaco LIMS\nTechpaper Umbrella Systems\n25.

La mayoría\nde países han aprobado leyes que obligan a los proveedores\nde servicios de telecomunicaciones a prestar apoyo a los\norganismos de orden público con peticiones debidamente\nautorizadas para identificar, supervisar y suministrar todas\nlas comunicaciones electrónicas de personas y grupos\nespecíficos. Mientras que las normativas y los requisitos\nvarían según el país, los organismos internacionales y estadounidenses, como ETSI y ANSI, han desarrollado normas\ntécnicas de LI que harán más fácil el trabajo de los LEA\ny contribuirán a que las operadoras y los proveedores de\nservicios minimicen los costes. Aunque diversas normas de\nLI emplean terminología distinta, el modelo funcional básico\n\nmostrado en la figura 1 se aplica a todas las normas sobre\nLI y a todos los tipos de redes y servicios.\nLas funciones principales de cualquier solución de LI son\nacceder a la información relativa a la interceptación (IRI,\npor sus siglas en inglés) y el contenido de la comunicación\n(CC) de la red de telecomunicaciones, y suministrar la\ninformación en un formato estandarizado mediante la interfaz de transferencia a uno o más centros de supervisión de\nlos organismos de orden público. Por supuesto, antes de\nque se pueda efectuar la supervisión, las peticiones de\ninterceptación deben ser aprobadas y suministradas de\nforma adecuada a los puntos de acceso de interceptación\ndentro de la red del proveedor de servicios, y deben concluir correctamente después de que la autorización de interceptación venza. Asimismo, los requisitos de alta seguridad\nde los sistemas de LI son esenciales para evitar la posible\nmanipulación y abuso.\n\nArquitectura de LI general (modelo funcional)\nProveedor de servicios\nde telecomunicaciones\nFunción de red de\ntelecomunicaciones\n\nOrganismo\nde orden público\n\n)\n\nInterfaz\nde red\ninterna\n\nFunción\nde interceptación legal\n\nFunción\nde administración\n\nFunción de\ninterceptación interna\n\nFunción\nde supervisión\nAdministración\nde orden público\n\nFunción de acceso,\nmediación y suministro\nde IRI\nFunción de acceso,\nmediación y\nsuministro de CC\n\nIRI: información relativa\na la interceptación\n\nInterfaz\nde transferencia de LI\n\nFunción de recogida\npara IRI y CC\n\nCC: contenido de la comunicación\n\nFigura 1.

El sistema se puede configurar como una solución\ninicial de servidor único para miles de abonados y se puede\nampliar en un clúster de servidores múltiples que posibilite\nla supervisión en redes con millones de abonados.\n\nProveedor de servicios de telecomunicaciones\n\nOrganismo\nde orden público\n\nTM\n\nUtimaco LIMS\nINI (Interfaz\nde red interna)\nX1\n\nInterfaz de\ntransferencia\nde LI\nHI1\nHI2\n\nRed fija\n\nHI3\nX2\nX3\n\nX1\nX2\nX3\n\nRed móvil\n\nServidor de gestión\nDispositivo\nde mediación 1\n\nBase de datos\n\nDispositivo\nde mediación 2\n\nDescodificador SSL\n\nDispositivo\nde mediación 3\n\nPuerta de enlace\n\nCentro\nde supervisión\n\nX1\n\nISP (e-mail, VoIP,...)\n\nX2\nX3\n\n.\n.\n.\nDispositivo\nde mediación n\n\nINI: interfaz de red interna\nIRI: información relativa a la interceptación\nCC: contenido de la comunicación\n\nMódulo de alta\ndisponibilidad\nUnidad de aprovisionamiento remoto\n\nx1, x2, x3:\n\ninterfaces de red interna para aprovisionamiento de LI,\nIRI e intercambio de CC\nH1, H2, H3: interfaz de transferencia estándar al organismo de orden público\npara el aprovisionamiento de LI, IRI e intercambio de CC\n\nFigura 2. Arquitectura de Utimaco LIMS\n\n\n\nLos Plugtests son tests de interoperabilidad organizados por el Instituto Europeo de\nNormas de Telecomunicación (ETSI). Plugtest™ es una marca del ETSI.\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nServidor de gestión de LIMS\nEl servidor de gestión, el componente principal del sistema\nLIMS, incorpora el sistema de administración para todos\nlos módulos del sistema, la interfaz de usuario, así como\nla gestión de la seguridad para todo el sistema. El servidor\nmantiene una base de datos central de todos los objetivos\nde interceptación y de los LEA autorizados. Una vez introducido un objetivo de interceptación en el servidor de\ngestión, pasa automáticamente al punto de acceso de interceptación adecuado en la red.\n\nDispositivos de mediación de LIMS\nLos dispositivos de mediación de LIMS ejecutan todas las\ntareas relativas al suministro de comunicaciones interceptadas al organismo de orden público autorizado. La mediación\nabarca la conversión y el mapeado de los datos de interceptación recibidos de la red interna a los formatos, protocolos\ne interfaces pertinentes, según requieran los LEA. La información relativa a la interceptación a veces necesita ser almacenada provisionalmente en el dispositivo de mediación\nantes de que se pueda reenviar a su destinatario final.\nUtimaco ofrece la lista más completa del sector en cuanto\na dispositivos de mediación que soportan una amplia gama\nde tecnologías de redes, servicios, protocolos y estándares. Hay dispositivos de mediación de LIMS para más de\n200 elementos de redes diferentes de todos los grandes\nproveedores. La entrega de los datos interceptados cumple varias normativas nacionales y estándares nacionales\ne internacionales, como los de CALEA, ATIS, ETSI y 3GPP.\n\nPuntos de acceso de LIMS\nSegún las capacidades y la topología de la red, Utimaco recomienda enfoques activos o pasivos para interceptar los\ndatos de comunicación. En modo pasivo, las sondas de red\nse integran en una red de la operadora para filtrar, descodificar y reenviar los datos de interceptación a LIMS, al dispositivo de mediación adecuado respectivamente. Utimaco ha\ndesarrollado sondas de red especializadas para la inspección\nprofunda de paquetes de varios servicios de comunicación y\nprotocolos de aplicación, como correo electrónico, webmail,\nacceso a Internet, mensajería instantánea, voz sobre IP y\notros servicios basados en IP. Por otro lado, la interceptación\nactiva se refiere al método de gestionar capacidades de interceptación integradas de los elementos de redes disponibles, como switches o routers. En muchos usos reales, una\ncombinación de técnicas de interceptación activa y pasiva\nofrece los mejores resultados o es la única opción disponible.\n\nDescodificador de LIMS\nEl módulo de descodificador de LIMS se puede usar para\nhabilitar la LI en redes donde la sesión de comunicación esté\nencriptada por SSL/TLS entre el usuario y los servidores del\nproveedor. En entornos de correo electrónico, por ejemplo,\nel descodificador de LIMS puede desencriptar sesiones de\nPOP3S, SMTPS o IMAPS antes de que los correos electrónicos puedan ser supervisados y filtrados por el punto de\nacceso de interceptación.\n\nPuerta de enlace de LIMS\nEsta puerta de enlace de medios modulares se ocupa de la\nconversión en tiempo real entre las redes por conmutación\nde paquetes y las redes por circuito conmutado. La puerta de enlace de LIMS se suele necesitar en redes de VoIP\ndonde la interfaz de transferencia a los LEA precisa de la\n\nconversión de transferencia continua por RTP en señales\nMDT (multiplexación por división de tiempo). Además de la\nconversión de medios, la puerta de enlace de LIMS también puede actuar como puerta de enlace de señalización\nentre SS7, RDSI y SIP. El concepto de hardware modular\ndel producto permite soluciones personalizadas para redes\npequeñas, así como para redes grandes que soporten entre\n60 y 3.360 llamadas simultáneas.\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nHardware de LIMS\n\nUnidad de aprovisionamiento remoto de LIMS\n\nUtimaco LIMS funciona en servidores estándar comunes\nde Oracle® con el sistema operativo Oracle Solaris®. Los\nclientes pueden elegir desde configuraciones de un servidor único para redes pequeñas, hasta clústeres de servidores múltiples para grandes redes con millones de\nabonados y miles de objetivos de interceptación. La puerta\nde enlace de LIMS es un sistema blade altamente modular con ocho ranuras para diferentes CPU, DSP y módulos\nde tarjetas de línea.\n\nTodas las funciones administrativas y operativas del sistema de gestión de LIMS son accesibles remotamente con\nla misma interfaz gráfica de usuario que en la consola de\nadministración local. La unidad de aprovisionamiento\nremoto de LIMS (RPU, por sus siglas en inglés) garantiza\nque se apliquen las mismas políticas de seguridad tanto en\nlas sesiones remotas como durante el funcionamiento local.\n\nOpción de alta disponibilidad de LIMS\nLa opción de alta disponibilidad de LIMS permite a las operadoras crear sistemas de LI robustos con una disponibilidad del 99,999%. El avanzado software de supervisión del\nsistema de Utimaco reconoce todos los tipos de cuellos de\nbotella y fallos potenciales, y cambia automáticamente los\nprocesos del sistema a los servidores de reserva caliente\nen caso necesario.\n\nOpción de equilibrio de cargas de LIMS\nUtimaco LIMS está bien preparado para escalar con los\ncrecientes requisitos de ancho de banda en las modernas\nredes de telecomunicaciones. Los algoritmos de equilibrio de cargas dinámico distribuyen los datos interceptados\nde forma uniforme entre una serie de dispositivos de\nmediación.\n\nLIMS – w orl dw i de\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nUtimaco LIMS™\nVentajas clave\nSistema de interceptación vanguardista\n\nSeguridad y fiabilidad\n\nTras más de 16 años de experiencia y mejora continua,\nUtimaco LIMS ha pasado de ser un sistema de supervisión\npara redes móviles a convertirse en un paquete de interceptación completo para diversos tipos de redes y servicios. Hoy\nen día, Utimaco ofrece la lista más completa del sector en\ncuanto a elementos soportados de redes de proveedores y\npermite la interceptación legal en prácticamente cualquier\nred inalámbrica y por cable, así como el soporte de múltiples servicios, como telefonía, fax, SMS, MMS, Push-to-Talk,\nacceso a Internet, e-mail, VoIP y otros servicios basados\nen IP. En toda su arquitectura de software y hardware, la\nsolución de Utimaco se ha diseñado como sistema para\noperadores que cumple los criterios más exigentes en\nmateria de seguridad, fiabilidad y rendimiento. La solución\nUtimaco LIMS está aprobada por organismos reguladores nacionales y la usan más de 150 operadoras en todo\nel mundo.\n\nLa seguridad de las TI ha sido la actividad central de\nUtimaco desde su fundación en 1983. Así, Utimaco comprende bien los aspectos sobre seguridad y privacidad de\nla interceptación legal y ha implementado mecanismos de\nseguridad integral en todo el sistema LIMS.\n\nCumplimiento normativo\nUtimaco LIMS está diseñado para cumplir los estándares\nnacionales e internacionales de interceptación legal desarrollados por ETSI, 3GPP, ATIS y CableLabs. Utimaco\ncomparte su experiencia y sus conocimientos sobre estándares con socios y clientes con el objetivo de optimizar constantemente la solución y cumplir los requisitos específicos\nconforme a los distintos prerrequisitos técnicos y legislativos.\n\nRentabilidad\nUtimaco LIMS es un sistema centralizado que realiza todas\nlas tareas relativas a la LI de múltiples LEA en una red de\nservicios heterogénea. Al usar un único punto de acceso,\nlas operadoras pueden reducir sus costes de administración\nmediante la simplificación de la comunicación con los LEA\ny la reducción del esfuerzo de aprovisionamiento de operaciones de supervisión en la red. Las operadoras pueden\ninicializar, modificar o eliminar cualquier petición de LI en\ntoda la red en cuestión de minutos con la sencilla interfaz gráfica de usuario de Utimaco LIMS. Una vez instalado\nen la red, Utimaco LIMS apenas precisa mantenimiento.\nUtimaco puede proporcionar mejoras opcionales del sistema, por ejemplo, para nuevos servicios o nuevos equipos de\nred, como parte de un contrato de mantenimiento o según\nvaya siendo necesario.\n\nLos aspectos sobre seguridad de datos de\nLIMS™ incluyen:\nAutenticación y autorización mediante el uso de un\nsistema de administración de derechos granular\nque permite la definición precisa de tareas administrativas y operativas (control de acceso basado en\nroles).\nPista de auditoría completa con contabilidad detallada de todos los eventos de sistema y usuario con el\nfin de evitar el mal uso y la manipulación.\nSistema de alarma integrada para alertar de fallos\ndel sistema.\nComprobaciones periódicas de consistencia para\ngarantizar la integridad de los datos en la base de\ndatos de objetivos y en los puntos de acceso de\ninterceptación en la red.\nEncriptación del tráfico interno y externo de datos.\nAlmacenamiento encriptado de todos los registros\nde datos sensibles y eliminación total de datos de\nusuarios tras el vencimiento de la petición de LI.\nSeparación transparente de diferentes peticiones de\nLI y LEA y entrega aislada de datos de interceptación\na múltiples LEA.\nSin puertas traseras: Utimaco LIMS nunca permite\nel acceso a usuarios no autorizados ni por ningún\notro medio distinto a los descritos en la documentación. La seguridad de Utimaco LIMS ha sido verificada por organismos reguladores oficiales y los resultados de las interceptaciones han sido aprobados\ncon éxito por tribunales internacionales como pruebas admisibles.\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nArquitectura modular y escalable\n\nServicios gestionados de LI\n\nMientras que el sistema está diseñado para redes de gran\nescala con millones de abonados, el paquete LIMS se puede adaptar con facilidad para ofrecer una solución viable\neconómicamente para redes de tan sólo algunos miles de\nusuarios. De hecho, la arquitectura del software modular\npermite a las operadoras ampliar el sistema a medida que\naumenta la demanda de interceptación legal y/o el conjunto\nde abonados. Los procesos y las tareas de rendimiento crítico pueden migrar a servidores dedicados para aumentar la\ncapacidad global del sistema y su rendimiento. La plataforma de hardware subyacente, basada en servidores Oracle®,\nconstituye una base sólida para un sistema escalable de\nconfianza con suficientes reservas de rendimiento para\ncualquier tamaño de red actual o futuro.\n\nLa administración de usuarios basada en roles de LIMS,\njunto con su capacidad para prestar servicio a múltiples redes distintas y LEA a la vez, permite varios modelos de uso\ndel sistema de interceptación legal. Las operadoras pueden\ninstalar y utilizar el sistema LIMS como parte de su propio\nsistema de soporte de operaciones (OSS, por sus siglas en\ninglés) o pueden decidir usar el servicio de un proveedor independiente de servicios de LI. Utimaco ha seleccionado y\naprobado una serie de proveedores de servicios de LI que\npueden encargarse, de forma efectiva, de todas las tareas\nadministrativas relativas a la LI y, por tanto, aliviar a la operadora de red de obligaciones no rentables y reducir los costes de mantenimiento y mejora de los sistemas.\n\nSoporte y prestación de servicios globales\nEl concepto modular de LIMS también facilita la integración\nde nuevas interfaces de red y protocolos sin que sea necesaria la reingeniería del sistema completo. No hay prácticamente ningún límite para el número de puntos de acceso\nde interceptación activos y pasivos que puedan conectarse\ny funcionar en paralelo.\n\n\nUtimaco cree que la gestión de la LI no se trata simplemente\nde la compra de hardware y software, sino que versa sobre\nla implementación de capacidades conforme a los requisitos legales nacionales y los prerrequisitos técnicos. Utimaco\nproporciona los servicios, el soporte y los recursos para\nayudarle a cumplir estas condiciones y a minimizar los\ncostes y los esfuerzos de instalación y utilización. Con la\nayuda de Utimaco, su personal puede llevar a cabo las tareas de interceptación legal y, al mismo tiempo, mantener\nla red operativa con el máximo nivel de rendimiento y utilización. Utimaco presta servicios de asesoría especializada\nen todo el mundo, asistencia técnica las 24 horas del día,\nsoporte en línea, formación en línea y servicios de instalación.\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nAcerca de Utimaco\nDesde hace más de 25 años, Utimaco es uno de los más\nimportantes proveedores mundiales de soluciones de\nseguridad de datos.

Most countries have passed laws that\nrequire telecommunication service providers to support\nLEAs with duly authorized requests to identify, monitor, and\ndeliver all of the electronic communications of specified\nindividuals and groups. While regulations and requirements\nvary from country to country, international and US-American\nstandardization bodies like ETSI or ANSI have developed\ntechnical standards for LI that will facilitate the work of LEAs\nand help operators and service providers to minimize their\ncosts. Although various standards for LI use different terminology, the basic functional model shown in figure 1 applies\nto all LI standards and to all network and service types.\n\nThe main functions of any LI solution are to access Interception-Related Information (IRI) and Content of Communication (CC) from the telecommunications network and\nto deliver the information in a standardized format via the\nhandover interface to one or more monitoring centers of\nlaw enforcement agencies. Of course, before surveillance\ncan take place interception requests must be approved\nand appropriately provisioned to the Interception Access\nPoints within the service provider’s network, and they must\nbe carefully and accurately terminated after the interception authorization expires. In addition, high security requirements for LI systems are essential to prevent possible\nmanipulation and misuse.\n\nGeneral LI Architecture (Functional Model)\nTelecommunication\nService Provider\nTelecommunication\nNetwork Function\n\nLaw Enforcement\nAgency\nInternal\nNetwork\nInterface\n\nLawful Interception\nFunction\nAdministration\nFunction\n\nInternal Interception\nFunction\n\nMonitoring\nFunction\nLaw Enforcement\nAdministration\n\nAccess, Mediation,\nDelivery Function\nfor IRI\nAccess, Mediation,\nDelivery Function\nfor CC\n\nIRI: Interception Related Information\n\nLI\nHandover\nInterface\n\nCollection Function\nfor IRI and CC\n\nCC: Content of Communication\n\nFigure 1.

As an active\nmember of the ETSI LI group, Utimaco has participated in\ndeveloping standards and in ETSI Plugtests1. The Utimaco\nLawful Interception Management System (LIMS) is a\ncomprehensive solution that provides state-of-the-art\nsurveillance capabilities for fixed and mobile communication networks and for various communication services,\nincluding traditional circuit-switched voice, next-generation\npacket-switched networks, 2G/3G mobile networks, and\nInternet-based services like e-mail and VoIP.\n\nThe core competency of the Utimaco LI solution is its\nability to interface with hundreds of different elements in a\nprovider’s heterogeneous network and to filter and deliver\ntarget-specific data to the LEA in a standardized format.\n\nThe LIMS solution usually acts as a bridge or mediator\nbetween the service provider’s network and the LEA’s\nmonitoring centers.\n\nThe Utimaco LIMS solution, as illustrated in figure 2, consists of the following components:\n\nThe LIMS modular architecture provides a future-proof\npath for operators to expand their LI capabilities throughout current and any future networks. The system can be\nconfigured as an entry-level single-server solution for\nthousands of subscribers and is scalable up to a multiserver cluster that enables monitoring in networks with millions of subscribers.\n\nTelecommunication Service Provider\n\nLaw Enforcement\nAgency\n\nTM\n\nUtimaco LIMS\n\nLI Handover\nInterface\n\nINI (Internal\nNetwork Interface)\nX1\n\nHI1\nHI2\n\nFixed Network\n\nHI3\nX2\nX3\n\nX1\n\nManagement Server\n\nMediation Device 1\n\nDatabase\n\nMediation Device 2\n\nDecoder SSL\n\nMediation Device 3\n\nGateway\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nHigh-Availability Module\n\nMediation Device n\n\nRemote Provisioning Unit\n\nMonitoring Center\n\nX2\nX3\n\nMobile Network\n\nX1\n\nISP (e-mail, VoIP,...)\n\nX2\nX3\n\nINI: Internal Network Interface\nIRI: Interception Related Information\nCC: Content of Communication\n\nx1, x2, x3:\n\nInternal Network Interfaces for LI Provisioning, IRI\nand CC exchange\nH1, H2, H3: Standard handover interface to the Law Enforcement\nAgency for LI Provisioning, IRI and CC exchange\n\nFigure 2.

Plugtest™ is a trademark of ETSI.\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nLIMS Management Server\nThe Management Server, the core component of the LIMS\nsystem, incorporates the administration system for all system\nmodules, the user interface, as well as security management\nfor the whole system. The server maintains a central database of all intercept targets and authorized LEAs. Once an\nintercept target is entered into the Management Server, it\nis automatically provisioned to the appropriate interception\naccess point in the network.\n\nLIMS Mediation Devices\nThe LIMS Mediation Devices perform all tasks related to\nthe delivery of intercepted communications to the authorized law enforcement agency. Mediation encompasses\nthe conversion and mapping of interception data received\nfrom the internal network to the appropriate formats, protocols and interfaces as required by the LEAs. Also, Intercept Related Information sometimes needs to be stored\nintermediately in the Mediation Device before it can be\nforwarded to its final recipient.\nUtimaco offers the industry’s broadest list of mediation\ndevices supporting a wide range of network technologies,\nservices, protocols and standards. There are LIMS Mediation Devices for more than 200 different network elements\nof all major vendors. Delivery of intercepted data is compliant with various national regulations and national and\ninternational standards including CALEA, ATIS, ETSI and\n3GPP standards.\n\nLIMS Access Points\nDepending on the network topology and capabilities,\nUtimaco recommends either active or passive approaches to\nintercepting communication data. In passive mode, network\nprobes are integrated into the operator’s network to filter, decode and forward intercept data to the LIMS, respectively to\nthe appropriate Mediation Device. Utimaco has developed\nspecialized network probes for deep-packet inspection of various communication services and application protocols such\nas e-mail, webmail, Internet access, instant messaging, Voiceover-IP and other IP-based services. Active interception, on\nthe other hand, refers to the method of managing integrated\ninterception capabilities of the available network elements,\nlike switches or routers. In many real-world deployments a\nmixture of active and passive interception techniques provides the best results or is the only available option.\n\nLIMS Decoder\nThe LIMS Decoder module can be used to enable LI in\nnetworks where the communication session is SSL/TLS\nencrypted between the user and the provider´s servers.\nIn e-mail environments, for instance, the LIMS Decoder\nis able to decrypt POP3S, SMTPS or IMAPS sessions\nbefore the e-mails can be monitored and filtered by the\nInterception Access Point.\n\nLIMS Gateway\nThis modular media gateway handles the real-time conversion between packet-switched networks and circuitswitched networks. The LIMS Gateway is often needed in\nVoIP networks where the handover interface to the LEAs\nrequires conversion of RTP media streams into TDM\n\n(Time Division Multiplexing) signals. In addition to the\nmedia conversion, the LIMS Gateway can also act as a signaling gateway between SS7, ISDN and SIP. The product’s\nmodular hardware concept enables customized solutions\nfor small networks, as well as for large networks supporting\nfrom 60 to 3,360 simultaneous calls.\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nLIMS Hardware\n\nLIMS Remote Provisioning Unit\n\nUtimaco LIMS runs on industry-standard servers by\nOracle® with Oracle Solaris® operating system. Customers\ncan choose from single-server configurations for small\nnetworks up to multi-server clusters for large networks with\nmillions of subscribers and thousands of intercept targets.\nThe LIMS Gateway is a highly modular blade system with\neight slots for different CPU, DSP and line card modules.\n\nAll administrative and operational functions of the LIMS\nManagement System can be accessed remotely using\nthe same graphical user interface as on the local management console. The LIMS Remote Provisioning Unit (RPU)\nensures that the same security policies apply to both\nremote sessions and to local operation.\n\nLIMS Loadbalancing Option\nLIMS High-Availability Option\nThe high-availability option for LIMS enables operators to\nbuild robust LI systems with 99,999% availability. The advanced Utimaco system monitoring software recognizes all\nkind of potential failures and bottlenecks and automatically\nswitches system processes to hot-standby servers when\nnecessary.\n\nUtimaco LIMS is well prepared to scale with the ever increasing bandwidth requirements in modern telecom networks. Dynamic loadbalancing algorithms distribute intercepted data evenly among a range of mediation devices.\n\nLIMS – w orl dw i de\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nUtimaco LIMS™ –\nKey Advantages\nState-of-the-Art Interception System\n\nSecurity and Reliability\n\nAfter over 16 years of experience and continuous improvement, the Utimaco LIMS has matured from a surveillance\nsystem for mobile networks to a complete interception\nsuite for various kinds of networks and services. Today\nUtimaco offers the industry’s most comprehensive list of\nsupported vendor network elements and enables lawful\ninterception in virtually any wireless and wireline network\nsupporting multiple services, including telephony, fax, SMS,\nMMS, Push-to-Talk, Internet access, e-mail, VoIP and other\nIP-based services. In its entire software and hardware\narchitecture the Utimaco solution has been designed as a\ncarrier-grade system that meets highest security, reliability\nand performance criteria. The Utimaco LIMS solution is\napproved by national regulatory bodies and is used by more\nthan 150 operators worldwide.\n\nIT security has been Utimaco’s core business since its foundation in 1983. As such, Utimaco thoroughly understands the\nsecurity and privacy aspects of lawful interception and has\nimplemented end-to-end security mech-anisms throughout\nthe entire LIMS system.\n\nThe data security features of LIMS™ include:\nAuthentication and authorization by using a\ngranular rights management system that enables\naccurate definition of administrative and operational tasks (role-based access control).\nFull audit trail with detailed accounting of all user and\nsystem events to avoid misuse and manipulation.\n\nStandards Compliance\nUtimaco LIMS is designed to comply with national and\ninternational lawful interception standards developed by\nETSI, 3GPP, ATIS and CableLabs. Utimaco shares its\nexperience and expertise in standards with partners and\ncustomers to continuously optimize the solution and to\nmeet specific requirements according to individual technical and legislative prerequisites.\n\nCost-Efficiency\nThe Utimaco LIMS is a centralized system that serves all\nLI-related tasks of multiple LEAs on a heterogeneous service network. By using one single point of access, operators can reduce their administration costs by simplifying\nthe communication with LEAs and by reducing the effort\nfor the provisioning of surveillance operations in the network. Operators can initiate, modify or delete any LI request on the entire network in a matter of minutes with the\neasy-to-use Utimaco LIMS graphical user interface. Once\ninstalled in the network, Utimaco LIMS is almost maintenance-free. Optional system upgrades, for example, for\nnew services or new network equipment, can be provided cost-efficiently by Utimaco as part of a maintenance\nagreement or on an as-needed basis.\n\nIntegrated alarm system to alert for system failures.\nRegular consistency checks to guarantee the data\nintegrity in the target database and on the interception access points in the network.\nEncryption of internal and external data traffic.\nEncrypted storage of all sensitive data records,\nand complete removal of user data after expiration\nof the LI request.\nTransparent separation of different LEAs and LI\nrequests, and isolated delivery of interception data\nto multiple LEAs.\nNo back doors: The Utimaco LIMS never permits\naccess to unauthorized users or by means other\nthan those described in the documentation.\nThe Utimaco LIMS security has been verified by\nofficial regulatory bodies, and interception results\nhave been successfully approved by international\ncourts as admissible evidence.\n\n\n\fUtimaco LIMS™\n\nModular and Scalable Architecture\n\nManaged LI Services\n\nWhile the system is designed for large-scale networks with\nmillions of subscribers, the LIMS suite can easily be adapted to provide an economically feasible solution for networks with only a few thousand users. In fact, the modular\nsoftware architecture enables operators to extend the system as the demand for lawful interception increases and/\nor their sub-scriber base grows. Performance-critical tasks\nand processes can be migrated to dedicated servers to increase the overall system capacity and throughput. The\nunderlying hardware platform, based on Oracle® servers,\nprovides the solid basis for a reliable, scalable system with\nsufficient performance reserves for all current and future\nnetwork sizes.\n\nThe LIMS role-based user management, together with its\ncapability to serve multiple different networks and LEAs\nconcurrently, allows various deployment models of the\nlawful interception system. Operators can either install and\noperate the LIMS system as part of their own Operations\nSupport System (OSS), or they may decide to use the\nservice of an independent LI service provider. Utimaco\nhas selected and qualified a number of LI service providers who can effectively take over all administrative tasks\nrelated to LI and thus relieve the network operator of unprofitable duties and reduce the costs for maintaining and upgrading systems.\n\nThe modular concept of LIMS further facilitates the integration\nof new network interfaces and protocols without requiring the\nreengineering of the complete system. There is virtually no\nlimit to the number of active and passive Interception Access\nPoints that can be connected and operated in parallel.\n\nGlobal Service and Support\n\n\nUtimaco understands that LI management is not simply\nabout purchasing hardware and software – it‘s about implementing capabilities according to national legal requirements and technical prerequisites. Utimaco provides the\nservices, support and resources that help you become\ncompliant with these requirements while minimizing the\ncosts and effort for installation and operation.

    "text": "Innovative And Proven\nCommunication\nIntelligence Solutions\n\n\fStrategic\nTelec0mmUnication\nNetW Ok~\nMonitoring\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGovernment security agencies face huge challenges in their combat\nagainst crime and terrorism. VASTech's telecommunicationnetwork\nmonitoring solutions provide an opportunity to meet these head-on.\n\nGovernments have an obligation to protect\ntheir sovereignty and protect their citizens\nagainst secunty threats and crime. In the\nmodern technological society, where terrorism\nand organised crime are ever-growing\nconcerns, achieving the above has become\nincreasingly difficult. This is due to the fact\nthat criminals and terrorists are -thanks\nto today's high-tech telecommunications\nnetworks - able to communicate more freely\nthan ever. However, these communications\ncan also be a rich source of intelligence and\nthe implementation of the right solutions\nto obtain this intelligence makes it possible to\nturn the tables in favour of security and stability.\nUnderstandingthe necessity of such\noperations, VASTech has developed passive\nmonitoring solutions that are designed\nto offer security agencies access to the\nmassive volumes of information generated\nvia telecommunications services, for the\npurposes of analysis and investigation. These\nsolutions offer users the power to review the\ncontent of communications over extended\nperiods of time, discovering new targets and\nuncoveringtheir relationships\nwith collaborators.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nMassive Passive Monitoring\nThe global nature of terrorism and crime\nthreats has increasedthe scope and demands\nof passive surveillance:\nLarge volumes of traffic need to be\nintercepted (1000's of ElS) to cover large\ngeographical areas;\nDifferent types of interfaces are required\n(El/rl; STM-1ISTM-4, Gigabit Ethemet);\nLarge storage capacity (Petabytes) and\nvast processing are required to intercept ail\npossible content and metadata;\nChanges in protocols or telecommunications\nenvironments continue to occur.\nThe VASTech Zebra solution is designed to\naddress these demands elegantly and flexibly.\nThe use of passive connectivity ensures isolation\nfrom the networks being monitoredand independence from operator personnel, thereby allowing\nindependent operation for the security agency.\nZebra offers sophisticated integrated tools to\ncorrelate signalling with bearer channels,\nanalyse protocols and extract content. Functions\nsuch as tagging, target selection, intercept\ncollections, flexible search, rules-based postprocessing and integration with external analysis\napplications allow the mass of information\nto be managed and manipulated to unearth\nthe hidden intelligence. The architecture\nis designed to intercept all content and\nmetadata of voice, SMS, MMS, email and fax\ncommunications on the connected networks,\ncreating a rich repository of information.\n\n\fEffective and Efficient\nThe Zebra solution can be deployed cost\nefficiently both in small and very large\nconfigurations. A high end system can\ncomprise of more than 100,000 simultaneous\nvoice channels, allowing it to capture up to\none billion intercepts per day and storing in\nexcess of 5,000 Terabytes of information.\nThe high density of connectivity, processing\nand storage results in a small footprint for\nthe solution.\nThe system is designed for TDM and IP\ntelecommunicationstraffic, ideally suitable for\nuse in mobile (GSM and 36) networks, fixedline networks, satellite carriers, high density\nfibre-optic cables and international gateway\nexchanges.\n\nss5 g BSMAP\n\nF M CLsccp\n\nC\n.r PSTN 4\n\neO\n\n-? + zhE\na\n\nGSM\n2\"\nA-INTERFACE\nW323\n-\n\nThe current reality is that criminals and enemies of the public\nhave access to very potent communication systems. Their ability\nto co-ordinate activities over vast distances is unprecedented,\ndemanding accurate and rapid response from security agencies.\nThe VASTech Zebra solution has been designed to provide the\nmeans to meet these challenges head on.\nZebra is part of VASTech's comprehensive product portfolio that\nincludes the Badger broadband interception system andadvanced\ncommunications analysis tools.\n\nThe Power\nto Act\n\n\fONE\nSOLUTION\nb Strategic passive surveillance system for\nVoice, Fax and SMS content in TDM and IP\ntraffic, on Satellite, PSTN and PLMN networks\nand fibre-optic cables\n\nb Providing massive capacity on-line storage for\ncommunications\n\nb Intercepting all traffic\nb Creating the ability to reach back in time\nand discover new targets and networks of\ncollaborators\n\n.\n\n\fUncover Communications\n\nUnified View, Unlimited Growth\n\nAll content is retained online in the Zebra system for\nextended periods of time, allowing immediate playback\nor viewing. Analysis of this intercepted data allows the\ninvestigator to identify targets and discern relationships\nwhich may have their origin years into the past.\nThe Zebra network view is particularly useful in this\nregard, as it allows for the visual exploration of a network\nof relationships and interactions, starting from any\nchosen communication. More crucially, Zebra offers\ninvestigators the opportunity to view or listen to the\ncontent of these past conversations, further enhancing\ntheir insight. This makes it possible for the analyst to\nuncover the hierarchy of an organisation, using as a\nstarting point a single conversation and reviewing current\nand historical communication.\n\nSince Zebra can be deployed as a secure distributed\nsolution, comprising multiple Zebra Capture Units, it\nenables the intercept points to be located close to the\npoint of traffic aggregation. A unified view is offered\nacross all these intercept points, allowing for a single\nintegrated interpretationof all telecommunications in the\nsystem. The ability of the solution to interact with a mix\nof interfaces and backhaul traffic from remote locations\nenables it to be deployed exactly according to individual\ncustomer needs. Depending on the legal mandate of the\nsecurity agency, the coverage can include a mix if all\ninternal communications, communications traversing the\ncountry's borders and satellite communication outside\nthe borders.\nMoreover, as customer requirements evolve, existing\nZebra Capture Units can be expanded or additional\nUnits deployed to accommodate any increase in\ntraffic volumes. The integrated CIC mapping function\nenables rapid configurationof signalling with arbitrary\nconnections of carriers, while signalling information can\nbe shared amongst capture units in different locations. In\naddition, roaming support for mobile devices allows the\nend user to be identified, regardless of where he travels.\n\n\fBenefitS\n\nFull spectrum coverage: Accepts intercepts from a variety of networks - GSM and 3G mobile\nnetworks, fixed line networks, satellite communications, international telecommunications\ngateway, high density fibre-optic cables.\nPower: Ability to scale to process and store massive volumes of data.\nStrategic Intelligence: Power and capacity to record everything, content included; allows for proactive intelligencegathering and the reconstructionof communications scenarios after an incident,\nexposing collaboration networks visually.\nFlexibility: Able to adapt as the monitored environment technology and topology changes,\nevolves to meet changing user requirements, connects to all types of physical interfaces.\nCustomisation of the system is part of the design philosophy.\nScalability: Expands seamlessly to allow for additional gateways, processing power, storage\nand Capture Units.\nOne system: Unified view over entire deployment, regardless of Capture Unit location.\nEfficiency: Ultra-dense hardware ensures a small footprint that requires minimum floor space,\nelectricity, air conditioning and support.\nEase of integration: A powerful API allows the integration with existing customer applications\nand analysis systems.\n\nZebra Specifications\n\nF\n\nr1.10T0r;ow AND ACT1\n\nM G t S AND GWAGI I Y\n\nFUNCTIONS\n\nE11l-l Gat\n\nEach Zebra Capturn Unit can intempt over\n100,000 toll qualii voice channels (m&data and content) simultaneously.\n\nArbitrary input oomrectign,\nI\n\nZebra Datacentre unifies up to 200 Zebra\nCapture Units into a single system.\nI\n\n2GlGSM - GERAN B\n3GNMTS - UTRAN: RANAP\nGSM+UMTS: DTAP, SM\nVolP: SIP, SIP-I, SIP-T, H.323, H.244\nSDP, T.38\nISDN: LAPD, Q.931\n\nVASIech SA (Pty) Ltd 1 7 Quantum Road, Technopark.

It can connect to any\nrelational schema through a server-side, XML-based\ndata view. The VisuaLinks architecture includesthree\nlayers - the Client Layer, the Server Layer, and the\nData Layer.\n\n+\n\n+\n\nThe Client Layer is the end-user visualization\ncomponent (the VisuaLinks Client). The\nVisuaLinks Client is the user interface responsible\nfor the 3-D visual representation of data\nrelationships and patterns and is the means for\ndata extraction, analysis and output operations.\nThis GUI-based front-end is also used for system\nadministration, data modeling collaboration,\nnetwork analysis, rule-based operations and\nmany other user operations.\n\nThe Data Layer refers to the data accessed by\nthe Visual Clarity Server. This layer can be made\nup of any number of relational databases or even\nother servers that act as proxies to additional data\nlayers. Access to the Data Layer is tightly\ncontrolled by the Visual Clarity Server security\nsettings. Data access is also limited by the data\nmodeling processwhich defines the values in your\ndatabase returnedto users through VisuaLinks\nClient requests.\n\nVisuaLinks' integrated service components,\nincluding the DisambiguatoP, Matcher, Summary,\nand Miner, provide an unparalleled set of capabilities\nto support pattern detection and advanced data\nanalysis for a variety of applications. To date,\nVisuaLinks has been used with a host of different\ndomains of data, such as network traffic, medical\npatterns, pharmaceutical research, insurance fraud,\nbank transactions, drug trafficking, criminal\ninvestigations,terrorism, and many more.\n\nThe Server Layer (Visual Clarity Server) is\nresponsiblefor maintaining database connections,\nmaintaining user connections, maintaining\nsecurity profiles and storing the dynamicallylinked service components that represent the\nbusiness logic of the VisuaLinks application.\nEach of these service components is loaded\nduring the Visual Clarity Server startup process\nand accessed by users through requests from the\nVisuaLinks Clients.\n\nVisual Analytics Inc.\nww.visualanalytics.com\n(877) 4074VAl\n50 Citizens Way, Suite 202 Frederick, MD 21701\nCopyright0 May 2010 FW20, All rights resewed\n\n\fdata found during queries.\n\nFind all of an\nobject's direct and\nindirect connections.\n\n-\n\n.\n\nM\n\nk\n\nYC\"ZX&%~gi;\n\n\"d\n\non a variety of maps.\n\nPlot data along\ndate-based time lines.\n\nVlsual Analytics Inc.\nwww.visualanalytics.com\n(877) 407-4VAl\n50 Citizens Way, Suite 202 Frederick, MD 21701\nCopyrightQ May 2010 FW20, All rights reserved\n\n\fIntegration\nVisuaLinksa connects directly to your existing data sources\nincluding any commercial relational database system and a\nvariety of file types.

Data sharing has become a highpriority in many market sectors, but there are numerous practical\nchallenges to delivering on this difficult challenge: disparate\ndatabase systems with differing schemas, structured (tabular\ndatabase information) versus unstructured data (Microsoft Word\ndocuments, PDF files, web pages, etc.), varying security\nrequirements, and performance and cost considerations.\nVisual Analytics' Digital Information Gateway (DIG) solves this\nproblem. DIG provides the means bv which vou can search anu\n\nI HIGH DATA VOLUMES\n\nSHARING DATA SOLVE1\n\nHow does DIG solve this challenge?\n\nI HOMOGENIZED DA\"\nDIG provides a layer of \"abstraction\" for each data source\nunder its control, \"mapping\" a standard schema to the columns\nof each shared source. When a user receives query results, all\ncolumns returned adhere to this schema, regardless of the\nname given to any column in the source database. Differences\nbetween sources are hidden from the end-user, giving the enduser the illusion of querying a single, vast, database.\n\nFDigital\n-\n\nDIG promotes a higher degree of data consumption when\ncompared with standard web sites or Portals. This is due to\nthe automation, and multi-faceted nature, of the federated\nsearch. Giving users access to more of your data as well as\nthe data of other agencies, can boost the value of your data to\nthat user.\n\nINFORMATION\nGATEWAY\n\nl INSTANT SOA\nWhat's Instant SOA? It's the instant transformation bi your data\ninto a Services Oriented Architecture that can be leveraged by\nanyone with access to the DIG network.

All rights resewed\n\n\fThe Power of\ntnformation Sharing\nThrough\nCollaborative Analfljes\n\nThe Data Clarity Suite takes advantage of the unique\nServer-to-Server (S2S) technology developed by Visual\nAnalytics. The S2S technology seamlessly connects local\nand remote data sources into a network of distributed\ndatabases and users across different agencies1\norganizations.\nThe network forms what some people would consider the\nultimate virtual data warehouse. Unlike traditional data\nwarehouses which are cumbersome, complex, and\nexpensive to implement, the S2S approach enables each\nowner of data in the network to maintain control and\nsecurity of the data while allowing access to the data. This\napproach removes all cost and security concerns as data is\nnever copied or moved from its original location and each\nowner maintains full control over access. Furthermore,\nsince the data access logs are recorded locally for each\nsite or data source, the owners have full disclosure over\nhow their data is being utilized.\nEach location in the network runs its own DIG Server\ncreating maps and views of data that the consumers of the\nnetwork will be able to access. This innovative approach to\ndata sharing ensures that:\n\n+ Data is always up to date (never copied or duplicated)\n+ There are no ownership issues (owners of the data\nmaintain their ownership)\n\n+ Security, data access, and data purity is maintained by\n+\n\nthe original owners of the data\n(no changes can be made by outside users)\nThere is no costly translation, fixed schema, or data\ntransport (as would be required by a data warehouse\nor other approaches)\n\nAdding new data to a S2S network can literally take a\nmatter of hours or even minutes - it is a simple process of\ndeciding what data should be made available within the\nnetwork and who will be granted access.\nOur S2S technology is the single best approach to finding\ncriminals utilizing data across multiple data sources or\nmultiple agencies and can be used inter-state or on a\nnational basis in a relatively short time frame. With the\nS2S approach, the network data is always live and up-todate, whenever any source of information in the network\nis updated, all end-users with the appropriate\npermissions can find and utilize the information in a\ntimely manner.\n\nSecurity, data access, and data purity\nis maintained by the original owners of the data\n\nVisual Analytics Inc. www.visualanalytics.com (877) 407-4VAI\n50 Citizens Way, Suite 202 Frederick, MD 21701\nCopyrighD May 2010 FW20, All rights reserved\n\n\fCornbating Terrorism\nTerrorism is a global threat influencing the attitude and\nbehavior of a target group by threatening - or carrying out\ndevastating actions.

The high quality\nand in-depth technical details of\nVUPEN1s research reports provide a\nunique way to mitigate and respond to\nzero-day attacks. Organizations with\ncritical infrastructures and networks\nneed and appreciate such vulnerability\nintelligence solutions with added\nvalues.\n\npp\n\nRichard Mattinez, Frost 6 Sullivan Analyst\n\n.\n\nI\n\n\n...\n\nVUPEN works closely with governments and major corporations to reduce their\nexposure to zero-day attacks and to address the security risks emanating from\ncyberspace.\nThe number of targeted and sophisticated cyber attacks taking advantage of\nunpatched vulnerabilities in major software is significantly increasing. Recent attacks\nhave demonstrated the need for organizations to leverage the most advanced\nsecurity intelligence to protect critical infrastructures and assets.\nMajor software vendors usually take 6 to 9 months to release a security patch for\ncritical vulnerabilities affecting their products, and this long delay between the\ndiscovery of a vulnerability and the release of a patch creates a window of exposure\nduring which criminals can rediscover a previously reported but unpatched\nvulnerability, and target any organization running the vulnerable software.\nTo respond to this challenge, VUPEN Threat Protection Program (TPP) aims to\ndeliver exclusive research reports and attack detection guidance for undisclosed\nvulnerabilities discovered in-house by VUPEN security researchers, providing timely,\nactionable information and guidance to help mitigate risks from unknown\nvulnerabilities or exploits. This is a proactive approach to aid governments and\ncorporations in making decisions in response to potential threats on a real-time basis\nand in advance of public disclosure, maintaining a secure environment while the\naffected vendor is working on a patch.\nAccess to this program is restricted to major corporations and governments under\nNDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).\n\nBasic L e v e l\n\n.30 credits'\"\n..Brief\ntechnical description\nIn-depth technical analysis\n.Workaround Imitigationf2;\n\nContact us\n\nI\n\nEnhanced Level\n\n.40 creditsu)\n\n..\n..\n\nBrief technical description\nIn-depth technical analysis\nWorkaround I\nProof-of-concept (crash only)\n\nI\n\nComprehensive Level\n\n.50 credits(')\nBrief technical description\nIn-depth technical analysis\nWorkaround Irnitigati~n'~'\nProof-of-concept (crash only)\nCode execution exploit(2)\nAttack Detection guidancec2)\n\n..\n\n.\n.\n\n..\n\nPricing and Licensing\n\nVUPEN Security\nCap Omega - CS 39521\nRond-point Benjamin Franklin\n34960 Montpellier Cedex 2\nFrance\n\nVUPEN Threat Protection Program is priced as a prepaid annual subscription based\non the chosen level.\n\nWebsite: www.vupen.com\nTwitter: twitter.wmNU PEN\nEmail: sales@vupen.com\n\nVUPEN has been recognized as 'Entrepreneurial Company of the Year in the\nVulnerability Research Market' by Frost & Sullivan.\n\nPhone: +33 467 130 094\nFax: +33 467 130 095\n\nAbout VUPEN Security\n\nVUPEN team includes highly skilled and motivated security researchers dedicated to\nfinding criiical and unpatched vulnerabilities in prominent and widely deployed\nsoftware created by Microsoft, Adobe, Sun, Apple, Oracle, Novell, and others.\n\n\f",

Fundamentals\nThis offer is based upon a request of Thomas Fischer of Gamma International as well as on various\nconversations between Gamma International, Dreamlab Technologies AG and the end customer.\n1.1 Starting point and objectives\nDuring the integration tests in Oman in September 2010 the end customer figured out that not all of the\ncomponents of the iproxy infrastructure are under their full control. It is, for example possible that changes of the\nOman-network may occur without their knowledge. Thus, it might occur that ISPs may modify some of the current\nconfiguration. Therefore, the question arose whether it is possible to identify such a modification in the network\nsetup by monitoring the whole iproxy infrastructure.\nFrom this point of view, a request for an efficient and user-friendly monitoring of the iproxy infrastructure including\nall components of the systems was derived. This requirement is discussed and a proposal for solution is\ndescribed in this offer.\nThe solution covers several aspects:\n•\n\nAll components of the iproxy infrastructure and all services running on the systems will be monitored.\n\n•\n\nFor defined critical outages of the hardware components, processes and/or services the system will send\nSMS- and/or e-mail-alarms to persons defined beforehand.\n\n•\n\nA web-based management GUI offers a wide range of views, which allow the operators to easily identify\nsystem issues and outages.\n\n•\n\nA set of reports offers possibilities to retrieve condensed information on the system like statistics on\noutages or performance problems.\n\nDreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMonbijoustrasse 36 CH-3011 Berne\n\nT + 41 31 398 66 66 F + 41 31 398 66 69 contact@dreamlab.net http://dreamlab.net/\n\n5/41\n\n\fQuotation: Monitoring system for iproxy-project\nCommercial in Confidence © Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\n2.

Project workflow and deliverables\n3.1 Overview of the actual iproxy infrastructure\n3.1.1 Network infrastructure for the iproxy infrastructure\nIn 2010, the infection proxy solution for the fixnet part was implemented on-site in Oman. The picture below\nshows the network infrastructure and the setup as currently implemented.\n\nIllustration 1: Current topology of the network with infection proxies\n\nDuring the tests in Oman, the end customer asked for a monitoring possibility of the iproxy infrastructure with the\ngoal to identify changes and modifications of the setup.\nThe following quotation specifies the elements of the proposed monitoring system.\n\nDreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMonbijoustrasse 36 CH-3011 Berne\n\nT + 41 31 398 66 66 F + 41 31 398 66 69 contact@dreamlab.net http://dreamlab.net/\n\n7/41\n\n\fQuotation: Monitoring system for iproxy-project\nCommercial in Confidence © Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\n3.2 Overview of the monitoring solution\n\nThe proposed solution is based on the implemented iproxy infrastructure. The monitoring will cover all hardwareand software components of the iproxy infrastructure, e.g. the management infrastructure, the AAA-probes and\nthe iproxies. The picture below gives an overview of the elements needed for the monitoring system.\n\nIllustration 2: Proposed monitoring solution:The green dashed lines show the monitoring of the radius probes, the\niproxies at the internet exchanges and the management server. The monitoring server detects and stores events\nin the monitored infrastructure and sends alarms by SMS and emails to the responsible technical staff members\nupon defined cases. The second monitoring server (in light blue) indicates the redundant monitoring cluster.\n\nDreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMonbijoustrasse 36 CH-3011 Berne\n\nT + 41 31 398 66 66 F + 41 31 398 66 69 contact@dreamlab.net http://dreamlab.net/\n\n8/41\n\n\fQuotation: Monitoring system for iproxy-project\nCommercial in Confidence © Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\n3.3 Functional overview of the monitoring solution\nThe proposed monitoring solution is based on Nagios-Munin, the state-of-the-art monitoring software.\nComponents to be monitored\nThe following system components of the iproxy infrastructure are subject to monitoring (see picture 2 on page 8):\n•\n\nthe management server at the LEA (ADMF)\n\n•\n\nthe 2 AAA-probes for the IP-access and WIFI\n\n•\n\nthe 2 iproxies at the internet exchange\n\nFor the named components the monitoring system will be configured with agents to monitor several layers (see\nPicture 3 below):\nHardware Layer Monitoring:\n\nImportant hardware components will be monitored like disks, CPUs, raidcontroller, power (on/off) or network cards, plugging / unplugging of cables.\nFor these elements checks will be made in order to control the hardware\ncondition .\n\nSystem Layer Monitoring:\n\nSystem processes are monitored and important data and aspects like disc\ncapacity, RAM capacity, CPU performance etc. will be checked. Errors and\nsystem critical values (for example: disc capacity over 80% etc.) are detected.\nRegular alive-checks are done.\n\nApplication Layer Monitoring:\n\nAn overall process check on each machine gives important information on the\noverall condition of the monitored element.\n\nIllustration 3: The proposed monitoring consists of several levels. On the lower levels hardware components,\nsystem and application processes are monitored. On a higher level services (like iProxy 2) are monitored.\nDetailed presentations of the graphical user interface are shown in appendix in ch. 10, p. 23ff.\nDreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMonbijoustrasse 36 CH-3011 Berne\n\nT + 41 31 398 66 66 F + 41 31 398 66 69 contact@dreamlab.net http://dreamlab.net/\n\n9/41\n\n\fQuotation: Monitoring system for iproxy-project\nCommercial in Confidence © Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\nHowever, smart monitoring does include more than monitoring all the components. Only when combining and\nunderstanding the components as a whole service the results of a monitoring are good results. Thus, the\nmonitoring is service-oriented where the components and its dependencies are included.\nIn our proposal we introduce two higher layers of services, while the first reflects “a site” (for example the NDP1).\nThus, it is possible to easily drill down information concerning site “NDP1” or site “management infrastructure\n(ADMF)” and hence, to identify in the monitoring whether the service of site “NDP1” is correctly working or not.\nOn the highest level, dependencies between the sites are introduced to build a view of the whole service. In order\nto introduce this view related to monitoring, deep insight in the real implementation of a service is needed. As a\nresult, the user gets qualified information about the service level of the monitored service, thus, reaching a level\nwhere monitoring is intuitively understood – also by non-application specialists.\n\nAlerting and alarming\nThe monitoring system allows to set up alerts on nearly any kind of event. Typical alerts are outages of hardware\ncomponents, exceeding of critical values like disc space usage, timeouts etc. Based on alerts, alarming\nmechanisms can be used to send an alarm by email or SMS to persons defined beforehand.\nExample for an alarm: assuming a network cable is unplugged at NDP1. The monitoring system triggers an alarm\nset up beforehand, which alerts the person in charge at LEA (for example by SMS or Mail).\n\nViews (for details also see the appendix on page 23)\nThe monitoring system will offer a set of views, which show the aspects of the monitoring system as described in\nthe previous section, and which are helpful when analysing problems, alerts and outages. Detailed examples and\nshort descriptions of the views are shown in the appendix on page 23ff.\nView\n\nShort description\n\nTactical view\n\nThe tactical overview always shows all service and host checks that are performed\nand gives an overview of the condition of the whole system and its corresponding\nservices. The monitoring platform is service-aware and knows which services\ndepend on what underlying systems. In case of outages or problems, this screen\ndirectly indicates the elements that need treatment.\n\nService details\n\nThe service overview pane dissects the rendered services in its components. Each\ncomponent is actively monitored and in case of failure, the operator knows exactly,\nwhich element is causing the issue.\n\nHost details\n\nThe host details pane shows all hosts participating in the system and its condition.\nFrom this screen the operator can drill in the detailed checks and their corresponding\nhistory.\n\nHost group summary\n\nModern services usually need more than one host to be rendered correctly. In the\nhost group pane the operator is shown the logical function blocks including its real\n\nDreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMonbijoustrasse 36 CH-3011 Berne\n\nT + 41 31 398 66 66 F + 41 31 398 66 69 contact@dreamlab.net http://dreamlab.net/\n\n10/41\n\n\fQuotation: Monitoring system for iproxy-project\nCommercial in Confidence © Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\nView\n\nShort description\ntime monitored condition, which is typically used for first line diagnosis of problems\nor anomalies.\n\nStatus host map\n\nThe host map shows the measured state in a topological manner.\n\nExtended host process\n\nThis detailed screen shows the specific monitoring configuration on a per-host-basis.\n\ninformation\nTrend host view\n\nWith the trending tool the overall availability and availability trends are being\ncalculated in a format, which delivers the perfect basis to calculate SLA aspects.\n\nTrend service view\n\nThis example shows service outages on a timeline. Perfect for reconstructing events\nor managing outages.\n\nService availability\n\nThis feature of the monitoring platform calculates on a per-host-basis the detailed\nservice availabilities in a defined timespan.\n\nOverview\n\nWith the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with\ninformal layouts and graphs. This tool is of great value and helps visualising the very\nlow-level technical measurements by transforming them into very informative and\nhigh-level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.\n\nMap overview\n\nCombining multiple views and graphs leads to considerably reduced debugging\ntimes. From the very high level layouts, the operator can access the rack view and\ntherefore see, where problems need treatment on a physical layer.\n\nSite Overview\n\nThis is another example of a very high-level and highly condensed system view.\nBear in mind that the informal layouts get enhanced by the various real time checks,\nwhich, when correlated and condensed, lead to one working or not working\nstatement per logical unit.\n\nVirtualized system\n\nWith this monitoring platform, even virtualised systems can be dissected and shown\n\noverview\n\nin informal graphs.\n\nSystem detail overview\n\nThis example shows all actual performance consumptions on all systems on one\nsingle page.\n\nScreen overview\n\nWith the additional performance graphs, every measurement is shown in detail in tie\nseries plots. Operators therefore get a very detailed view of every single aspect of a\nservice and host. With means of the time series and the operational knowledge the\noperators get a very detailed insight on any impact from any service providing the\nsystems.\n\nDreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMonbijoustrasse 36 CH-3011 Berne\n\nT + 41 31 398 66 66 F + 41 31 398 66 69 contact@dreamlab.net http://dreamlab.net/\n\n11/41\n\n\fQuotation: Monitoring system for iproxy-project\nCommercial in Confidence © Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\n3.4 Project management\nThe project management must be assigned to project planning, communication, and co-ordination; this will ease\nthe handling of all tasks that arise, such as in particular the co-ordination and communication within the teams,\nco-ordination of on-site work, collaboration with the parties involved, ordering and monitoring of duties to cooperate, guaranteeing of the provision of any existing dependencies, hardware assembly, factory testing, the\nprovision of all project-related documentation such as system and instruction manuals.\n3.5 Devices and infrastructure\nBefore the on-site installation, the hardware will be assembled, equipped and preconfigured with all software\ncomponents at Dreamlab Technologies.

Binary infection: The binary download mode is used to infect binaries that are\ndownloaded from the internet by the configured target. In order to do this, the\nsoftware analyzes the data streams on the NDPs at both of the internet\nexchanges (IX). As soon as a matching type of binary is downloaded, the infection\nmechanism is initiated, then it attaches loader and payload (trojan) to the binary.\n2. Update infection: The update infection mode works by sending counterfeit\nserver responses to predefined applications (for example iTunes, Winamp,\nOpenOffice and SimpleLite), when they are searching for updates. The NDPs\nanalyze the target's data streams and parse the application's update request.\nThen, they send back a conterfeit response back to the application, informing it\nthat the update wold be ready for download. The application subsequently starts\nthe download of the update which will be treated with loader and payload (trojan)\nby the NDP.\nAll the iProxy components are connected by the jabber protocol with the jabber server\nrunning on the ADMF. All communication paths are encrypted for security reasons. Also\nall components of the iProxy infrastructure are based on daemontools, a collection of\ntools for the high availability management of UNIX services.\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n7/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\n2.2 Overview of the infrastructure\n2.2.1 Infrastructure schema\n1x Bild gemäss Offerte mit Visio erstellen\n\n2.2.2 Infrastruktur Kommunikationswege\n1x Bild Visio Zusammensetzung unserer Komponenten mit Kommunikations wegen\n\n2.2.3 Infrastruktur Management Netzwerk\n1x Bild Visio Management Netzwerk\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n8/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\n2.2.4 IP- und Hostinformationen\nIP und Host Informationen\nStandort\n\nHost Name\n\nIP Adresse\n\nTbd.\n\nADMF-GUI\n\nTbd.\n\nTbd.\n\nADMF\n\nTbd.\n\nTbd.\n\nNDP01\n\nTbd.\n\nTbd.\n\nNDP02\n\nTbd.\n\nTbd.\n\nRP01\n\nTbd.\n\nTbd.\n\nRP02\n\nTbd.\n\nBeschreibung\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n9/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\n3.

Configuration advices\n5.1 Shorewall\nShorwall is a useful tool fir configuring the firewall built-in in Linux (iptables/netfilter).\nInstead of confuguring single, cryptic firewall rules, Shorewall works with zones, default\npolicies and rules controlling the traffic between the zones.\n5.1.1 Configuration files\nShorewall saves it's configurations in /etc/shorewall. For the iProxy environment, the\nfollowing files are relevant:\n●\n\nshorewall.conf – Basic settings for Shorewall\n\n●\n\nzones – Definition of zone names\n\n●\n\ninterfaces – Mapping between zones and network interfaces\n\n●\n\npolicy – Default policies for traffic between the zones\n\n●\n\nrules – rules for specified and customized traffic\n\nAs an example, a simple configuration is shown below. First the zone names are defined:\n## /etc/shorewall/zones\nfw\nfirewall\ninet\nipv4\nlan\nipv4\n\nThus the zone “fw” is defined. The paramenter “firewall” specifies that the present\nsystem is the system running Shorewall. Further, the zones “inet” and “lan”, used for\nIPv4 traffic, are defined.\nThe next step assigns the interfaces to the zones:\n## /etc/shorewall/interfaces\ninet eth0 detect\nlan\neth1 detect\n\nThis defines that eth0 belongs to the “inet” zone and eth1 to the “lan” zone.\nNow the default policies can be defined:\n## /etc/shorewall/policy\n# Firewall may connect to the zones inet and lan without limitations\nfw\ninet ACCEPT\nfw\nlan\nACCEPT\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n49/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\n# Traffic from inet or lan to fw wis dropped. Further, dropped traffic is logged,\nusing the log level “info”.\ninet fw\nDROP\ninfo\nlan\nfw\nDROP\ninfo\n# Disallow any communication between lan and inet.\ninet lan\nDROP\ninfo\nlan\ninet DROP\ninfo\n# Last rule, dropping all traffic from all zones to all zones.\nall\nall\nDROP\ninfo\n\nWth the polices described hereby, alread much is achieved: The firewall can connect to\nboth zones, while the zones “inet” and “lan” aren't allowed to connect to the firewall. In\norder to allow acces to defined services, correspondig rules are created:\n## /etc/shorewall/rules\n# Hosts in the zone “lan” are allowed to connect to the firewall using SSH and\nSMTP (Ports 22 and 25)\nACCEPT\nACCEPT\n\nlan\nlan\n\nfw\nfw\n\ntcp\ntcp\n\n\n# The same for DNS (udp port 53)\nACCEPT\nlan\nfw\nudp\n53\n# Hosts in the zone “lan” are allowed to ping the firewall (ICMP-Type 8)\nACCEPT\nlan\nfw\nicmp 8\n# Hosts in the zone inet are allowed to connect to the firewall using HTTPS.\nACCEPT\n\ninet\n\nfw\n\ntcp\n\n443\n\n# Hosts in the zone “lan” are allowed to connect to any HTTP and HTTPS service\nin the zone “inet”\nACCEPT\nlan\ninet tcp\n80,443\n\nShorewall translates these simple configuration options into rules for netfilter or iptables.\nSo the biggest part of the firewall's complexity isn't exposed to the system\nadministrator, allowing him to concetrate specifically on the logics of creating rule sets.\n5.2 E-mail distribution\nOn each system. Logwatch and logcheck are installed. These tools examine the system\nlog files and send exceptional log messages by mail. For this reason, an E-mail\ndistribution can be configured to spread these system notification mails.\nBsically, all systems can be configured with nulmailer. The following configuration would\nbe possible to send mails from all systems to the address example@example.org.\nDefinition of the Mail server that will distribute the messages:\n/etc/nullmailer/remotes\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n50/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\nmailer.example.org\n\nName of the source system for mail delivery:\n/etc/nullmailer/me\nadmf.example.org\n\nThe system's sender address:\n/etc/nullmailer/adminaddr\nsyscheck@example.org\n\n5.3 SSH\nSSH is used for system administration. The following requirements to it's configuraiton\nare defined and implemented by the iProxy environment:\n●\n\nChange default port 22 to 62200 (this prevents the system rom being found by\nautomated SSH scanning tools)\n\n●\n\nOnly allow SSH version 2\n\n●\n\nDirect root access is deactivated, a login with normal user accounts is fored.\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n51/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\n6. Miscellaneous HOWTOs\n6.1 Restart shorewall\nIn order to start the firewall (Shorewall), the folliwing command is used:\nUm die Firewall (Shorewall) zu starten wird folgendes Kommando ausgeführt:\nroot@host:~# shorewall safe-restart\n\nThus, the firewall is started into a safe mode and applies the defined rules inly in case\nthey function witout problems and the user allowes the application of the new ruleset by\npressing “y”. If the firewall shouldn' start up, or an error in the system configuration is\nfound, the previous firewall rule state is restored.\nAlso, the startup is aborted and the previous rules are restored, if the user doesn't\nconfirm the new riles by pressing “y” within 60 seconds. This allows the firewall to be\nconfigured by remote login without the risk of being locked out.\n\n6.2 Viewing log files\nIn the direcory /var/log/ several log files can be read and analyzed using the following\ncommands:\nroot@host:~# tail -n 500 /var/log/messages\n\nThus, the last 500 lines of the «messages» log file are displayed.\nroot@host:~# tail -f /var/log/messages\n\nThis displays the most recent log output of the «messages» in real time.\n6.3 Restart of the iProxy service\nThe components of the iProxy services reside in the following directory on every server:\n/home/iproxy/service/\nWithin this direcory, a further directory is created for each service. In there, the\nconfigurations and data reside in a structure defined by deamon tools.\nIn order to start the corresponding service, the directory of each software component\nmust be linked to /etc/service. This can be done by the following command:\ncd /home/iproxy/service\nln -s rp01 /etc/service\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n52/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\nThen, the service is started and will be restarted automatically with every machine\nreboot or possible crash of any iProxy component.\nTo stop the service permanently, the symlink must be removed from the etc/service\ndirectoy.\nTo only stop the service temporarily, or to restart it, the following commands are used:\nTo start the service:\nsvc -t /etc/service/rp01\n\nTo stop the service:\nsvc -d /etc/service/rp01\n\nTo restart the service:\nsvc -u /etc/service/rp01\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n53/55\n\n\fSystem Manual Project O.\n\n7.

Maintenance and suport\n8.1 Software maintenance\nTo assure the actuality and security of the iProxy environment, it's undergoing a\nmaintenance at defined time windows, when the most recent software versions will be\ninstalled. Of course, the software is under constant development and errors are\nrecovered and new features added. Nevertheless, maintenance and co-operation if the\ninfrastructure must be defined with the client individually.\n8.2 Contact address of Dreamlab Technologies AG\nDreamlab Technologies AG\nMonbijoustrasse 36\n3011 Bern\nTel. +4131 / 398 66 66\nFax. +4131 / 398 66 69\nFor general questions: contact@dreamlab.net\nFor technical questions: Fragen: richard.sademach@dreamlab.net\n\nPrepared for Oman\n© by Dreamlab Technologies AG All rights reserved\n\n55/55\n\n\f",

Basics\nThis offer arose as a result of an inquiry by Gamma International and a subsequent collective visit in\nTurkmenistan, as well as in consequence of the results of the current and ongoing network analysis.\nUnfortunately the network analysis is not yet terminated, therefore this quotation is heavily based on assumptions\nand preconditions.\nFurthermore this offer is based on a request of Gamma International of Dec 13 th for a reduced offer with respect\nto Offer 3104351.1 “Infection Proxy Project” of October 11 th 2010 which contained an offer for the Fixed-, the\nTMCell and the MTS network of Turkmenistan.\n1.1 Starting position and Objectives\nAfter an inquiry by Gamma International, Dreamlab Technologies (Nicolas Mayencourt) and Gamma International\n(Thomas Fischer) travelled to Turkmenistan. Preliminary investigations were made there concerning a network\nanalysis. This network analysis has in the meantime progressed a bit, and allows us, with assumptions and\npreconditions, to submit a project proposal.\nThe original aim of the quotation was to cover all Turkmen networks with the infection proxy functionality, fixed\nand mobile networks alike. This offer here is reduced to the Turkmentel Networks (Fixed and TMCell Mobile) only.\nThe LEA/LEMF will be able to operate and inspect this system through the Management Server as well as the\nManagement Client, both of which will be established within the LEA.\nAt the end of the project, the persons responsible should be trained in using the systems.\nAfter the conclusion of the project, Turkmenistan will possess an Infection Proxy Infrastructure and Solution\napplicable nationwide for all international traffic the Turkmentel and TMCell networks.\nIn this offer, all servers are offered as standalone systems in accordance with the request of Gamma\nInternational. This does not comply with the best practices of Dreamlab Technologies, which envisage a\nredundant implementation as a cluster for at least all systems that are network-related and involved in the\ninfection process.\n\n\f2.

Dreamlab also provides a Hacker Highschool to help\nyoung people to get aware of responsible handling of IT Technologies.\nThrough close partnership with ISECOM and an active collaboration in setting new standards, Dreamlab is always\nup to date and even ahead of its time. Being a honorary member of the security section of the Swiss Informatics\nSociety, a member of OpenTCPA Research Group and of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) means being\npart of the newest developments in IT Security. Within W3C, Dreamlab is responsible for the Xforms Standard\nand it is an active part of other working groups (e. g. HTML) to integrate security knowledge into processes of\ncreation and maintenance of future Standards. Customers of Dreamlab profit directly from this body of knowledge,\nfrom the contact network and from the insight into developments and future marketplaces.\nDreamlab‘s staff consists of skilled OSSTMM professionals who constantly observe the Security Branch and have\naccess to the newest developments and trends. To be able to advise their customers the best, they exchange\nknowledge on the most important international IT Security Conferences and continually educate themselves.\nSince 2005 Dreamlab has developped a Software-Suite for Lawful Interception and Data retention and\nsuccessfully implemented the solution at various customers in Switzerland and internationally. The Dreamalb LISW-Suite is unparalled with regards to security, performance, flexibility and price on the market. The softwarecomponents are under permanent development, are compliant with the common ETSI-standard and cover most\nof the interception requirements on all relevant technologies of IP-networks.\n\n\f3. Project Workflow and Deliverables\n3.1 Network Analysis\nAt the beginning of the project is a detailed network analysis, which will provide the following information:\nKnowledge about the local provider topology\nKnowledge about target-identification possibilities\nDeeper knowledge about the protocol stacks employed\nSolution strategy for implementation\nDocumentation about the OSS BSS-landscape\nAt the present moment, the network analysis has already commenced, and the first results and solution proposals\nare available.\n\nIllustration 1: Visualised network topology with Infection Proxies\n\n\fIllustration 2: Infection Proxy at Tmcell\n\n\f3.2 Project Management\nProject management must be assigned for project planning, communication, and co-ordination; this will coordinate all tasks that arise, such as in particular co-ordination and communication within the teams, co-ordination\nof on-site work, collaboration with the parties involved, ordering and monitoring of duties to co-operate,\nguaranteeing of the provision of any existing dependencies, hardware assembly, factory testing, the provision of\nall project-related documentation such as system and instruction manuals.\n\n\f3.3 Devices and Infrastructure\nBefore on-site installation, the hardware will be assembled at Dreamlab Technologies and equipped with all\nsoftware components. Additionally, a detailed burn-in test will be undertaken before shipping. The systems will be\ndelivered to the desired address in principle ready-to-use. Dreamlab will deliver the following hardware and\nsoftware components for the project and it's three use cases:\n3.3.1 Fixnet\nInfection Proxy\nThe infection proxy is the actual core-component of the system; through them the entire traffic of the target is\nconducted after the target identification. One non-accelerated infection proxy with 2 copper based dual port\nnetwork adaptors with 1 Gbit/s and automatic bypass function will be used.\nRadius Probes\nThe authentications of the targets are monitored through the radius probes, so that the infection proxy process\ncan be initiated. One radius probe with two 4-port Gigabit copper network interfaces will be used to monitor and\nintercept the accesses from the fixnet, as well as two 1 Gigabit ethernet TAP devices.\n3.3.2 Tmcell\nInfection Proxy\nThe infection proxy is the actual core-component of the system; through them the entire traffic of the target is\nconducted after the target identification. The TMCell network is basically divided in a Huawei and a NSN domain,\ntherefore we will need to double the infrastructure involved to cover all parts of the mobile networks. One domain\nconsists of a non-accelerated infection proxy with 2 singlemode fiber based dual port bypass network adaptors\nwith 1 Gbit/s and the other domain consists of a non-accelerated infection proxy with 2 copper based dual port\nbypass network adaptors with 1 Gbit/s.\nIdentification Probe\nThe identification probe will monitor and report the correlation between IMSI, TIMSI, MSISDN and the assigned IP\naddress in order to identify mobile users. One domain consists of an identification probe with two dual-port\nGigabit singlemode fiber network interfaces as well as two 1 Gigabit Fiber TAP devices, the second domain\nconsists of an identification probe with two dual-port Gigabit copper network interface as well as two 1 Gigabit\nethernet TAP devices. Both will be used to monitor and intercept the accesses from the Tmcell network .\n3.3.3 Management Server\nA management infrastructure will be applied for managing the infection proxies; this consists of a standard server\nwith management software and a client PC (Gamma-GUI) to administer the solution.\n\n\f3.4 Training\nPersons responsible will receive system training, including all necessary training documentation adapted for the\nclient system and in English.\n3.5 System Care\nSupport and maintenance covers all activities in support of the client during operation of the installed systems and\nin case servicing is needed.\n3.5.1 On-site Maintenance in Turkmenistan\nThe SLA can be fulfilled without remote access and in the scope of an annual visit at the client’s location, during\nwhich updates and tests can be carried out, or open questions can be discussed with the customer. This can\noccur every year, every semester, or every quarter. Since this is very much a security-related and sensitive\ninfrastructure, which is located in a public network, Dreamlab advises that the maintenance work be undertaken\nas frequently as possible (every quarter, if possible).\n3.6 Co-ordination Meetings\n1x per year, and in addition to the system maintenance, a co-ordination meeting with the client takes place onsite, during which the needs and requirements of the client can be discussed, and where relevant information,\nnews, and current trends can be exchanged on a management level.\n\n\f4. Limitations and Preconditions\nThis offer is made with the following limitations and preconditions. The following preconditions must be fulfilled by\nGamma International GmbH (hereinafter the client).\nI.The client will forego all assertion of claims on account of any possible adverse effects and/or damages that may\narise in connection with the assignment. Reserved are damages that arise through serious negligence or\ndeliberate actions or omissions by the staff of Dreamlab Technologies.\nII.The current approach covers all mobile and fix network of the country of Turkmenistan. Because vital data is still\nnot a 100% certain following possibly project and price relevant assumptions, limitations and preconditions apply\nto this offer.\nIII.Turkmentel Fixnet\nWe refer positioning to the layout NWGraph with the Cartesian coordinates and the two network traces\n(Turkmentel.pcap, Turkmentel2.pcap). We assume that the traffic sample Turkmentel.pcap has been taken on the\nlinks between 2950 (D6) and 2960 or NAT in (C/D 3).\na)\n\nAll NATed customer traffic flows through the links between 2950 (D6) and 2960 or NAT in (C/D 3)\n\nb)\n\nAll non NATed customer internet traffic flows though the link 2950 (D6) and Satgate (A7).\n\nc)\n\nAll dynamic IP's are solely provisioned via RADIUS.\n\nd)\n\nAll RADIUS traffic flows through the link between 2950 (D6) and 2960 or NAT in (C/D 3)\n\ne)\n\nThe only RADIUS dialog that is provisioning dynamic IP addresses is shown in the Turkmenistan.pcap\n\nin\n\npacket number 7 and 8. The property to set IP's is “FRAMED-IP-Address”. A sample for a failed\nAccess-Request is documented in packet 5 and 6 in the same tracefile.\n\nf)\n\nIf there are more RADIUS dialog variants they will be documented and outlined by the provider.\n\ng)\n\nWe assume there is no other or more dynamic IP provisioning mechanisms in place.\n\nh)\n\nAll fixed IP address traffic flows through the link 2950 (D6) and Satgate (A7).\n\nI)\n\nAll links are based on copper medium and support 10/100/1000 mbs ethernet.\n\nWe have found non internal source IP addresses in the Turkmentel.pcap sample and need an explanation\nhow this is possible.\nPlease do precisely document any additional information, differences, amendments or comments.\n\n\fIV.Turkmentel Cell\nThe Turkmentel Cell network delivers mobile IP services and is splitted in a Huawei and a NSN domain. Both\ndomains maintain one active and one passive link in between the SGSN and the GGSN\nHuawei domain:\na) The Huawei domain's network is based on copper 10/100/1000 mbs ethernet media\nb) The dynamic IP's of targets are provisioned on the Gn interface. The traffic sample\nTMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap contains all provisioning mechanisms.\nc) The mechanism for provisioning is showed in file TMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap in packet\n\n1548\n\nand 1560. The unique target identifier can be the IMSI or the MSISDN (phone number). In this sample the mobile\ntarget receives the IP address 172.16.190.73.\nd) All subsequent mobile IP traffic from the target is as well flowing through the same Gn interface found in\nTMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap .\ne) The same mobile IP traffic flows through the Gi interface found in TMCell_Huawei_GGSN-Gi- 2_active.pcap\nwithout GTP encapsulation.\nf) All mobile IP traffic is flowing through the Gn and Gi interfaces on the active and upon failure the passive link.\ng) The TMCell_Huawei_SGSN-Gn-1_active.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the SGSN\nand the GGSN\nh) The TMCell_Huawei_GGSN-Gi-2_active.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the GGSN\nand nsnfw01 and nsnfw02.\nNSN domain:\na)\n\nThe NSN domain's network is based on fiber 1000 gbs ethernet media\n\nb)\n\nThe dynamic IP's of targets are provisioned on the Gn interface. The traffic sample TMCell_NSN_0109Gn-1.pcap contains all provisioning mechanisms.\n\nc)\n\nThe mechanism for provisioning is showed in file TMCell_NSN_01-09Gn-1.pcap in packet 532 and\n533. The unique target identifier can be the IMSI or the MSISDN (phone number). In this sample the\nmobile target receives the IP address 172.19.8.243.\n\nd)\n\nAll subsequent mobile IP traffic from the target is as well flowing through the same Gn interface found\nin TMCell_NSN_01-09Gn-1.pcap.\n\ne)\n\nThe same mobile IP traffic flows through the Gi interface found in TMCell_NSN_01-09Gi-1.pcap\nwithout GTP encapsulation.\n\nf)\n\nAll mobile IP traffic is flowing through the Gn and Gi interfaces on the active and upon failure the\npassive link.\n\ng)\n\nThe TMCell_NSN_01-09Gn-1.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the SGSN and\nthe GGSN\n\nh)\n\nThe TMCell_NSN_01-09Gi-1.pcap traffic sample has been sniffed on the links between the GGSN and\nnsnfw01 and nsnfw02.\n\n\f5.

Through these data records of usage, the effective burden of the system can be visualised\ngraphically and it can be continually examined whether or not the system utilisation corresponds to the current\nneeds. In practice it is additionally the case that malfunctions or security problems affect the system usage. Via\nmonitoring such problems can thus be detected.\n\nMap 3: © by Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\nMap 4: © by Dreamlab Technologies AG\n\nIn addition, Dreamlab Technologies continually monitors the service availability. Service availability can be\ncalculated by means of the measurement data, as is shown by the following example:\n\nMap 5: © by Dreamlab Technologies AG\nBy this monitoring of service availability, the availability of a system within a specific timeframe (usually a month)\ncan be calculated.\nBoth these types of report (availability and usage) will be made available to the client every month (electronically,\nas a PDF). Only that which is measurable can be steered and controlled. For this reason, already a large number\nof clients rely on the service and security level agreements with Dreamlab Technologies. The reports are ITIL-\n\n\fcompliant and are therefore very well suited to the support of managed processes in a company.\n\n\f10.3 Alerting and Monitoring Infrastructure\n\n10.3.1 Nagios tactical Overview\n\nThe tactical overview always shows all service and host checks that get performed and gives and overview of the\nhealth state of the whole system and its corresponding services. The monitoring platform is service aware and\nknows which services depend on what underlying systems. In case of outages or problems this screen directly\nindicates the elements that need treatment.\n\n\f10.3.2 Nagios Service Details\n\nThe service overview pane dissects the rendered services in its components. Each component is actively\nmonitored and in case of failure the operator knows exactly which element is causing issues. Of course a history\nof all events is being kept.\n\n\f10.3.3 Nagios Host Details\n\nThe host details pane shows all hosts participating in the system and its health state. From this screen the\noperator can drill in the detailed checks and their corresponding history.\n\n\f10.3.4 Nagios Host Group Summary\n\nModern services usually need more than one host to be rendered correctly. In the host group pane the operator is\nshown the logical function blocks including its real time monitored health state. This is a great tool for first line\ndiagnosis of problems or anomalies.\n\n\f10.3.5 Nagios Status Host Map\n\nThe host map shows the measured state in a topological manner.\n\n\f10.3.6 Nagios Extended Host Process Information\n\nThis detailed screen shows the specific monitoring configuration on a per host basis.\n\n\f10.3.7 Nagios Trend Host View\n\nWith the trending tool the overall availability and availability trends is being calculated in a format which is a\nperfect basis to calculate SLA aspects.\n\n\f10.3.8 Nagios Trend Service View\n\nThis example shows service outages on a timeline. Perfect for reconstructing events or managing outages.\n\n\f10.3.9 Nagios Service Availability\n\nThis feature of the monitoring platform calculates on a per host basis the detailed service availabilities in a defined\ntimespan.\n\n\f10.3.10 Nagvis Overview\n\nWith the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with informal layouts and graphs.\nThis tool is of great value and help in visualising the very low level technical measurements on very informal and\nhigh level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.\n\n\f10.3.11 Nagvis Overview\n\nWith the Nagvis extension the whole monitoring infrastructure can be combined with informal layouts and graphs.\nThis tool is of great value and help in visualising the very low level technical measurements on very informal and\nhigh level views enabling the operator to quickly identify potential problems.\n\n\f10.3.12 Nagvis Map Overview\n\nThere is no limitation to the way the operator wants the service checks to be correlated and represented. In this\nexample a very high level country wide overview of a system is shown.\n\n\f10.3.13 Nagvis Rack Overview\n\nCombining multiple views and graphs lead to greatly reduced debugging times. From the very high level layouts\nthe operator can drill in up to the rack view and see where problems need treatment on a physical layer.\n\n\f10.3.14 Nagvis Site Overview\n\nThis is another example of a very high level and highly condensed system view. Bear in mind that the informal\nlayouts get enhanced by the various real time checks which all get correlated and condensed leading to one\nworking or not working statement per logical unit.\n\n\f10.3.15 Nagvis Overview\n\nWith this monitoring platform even virtualised systems can be dissected and shown in informal graphs.\n\n\f10.3.16 Nagvis System Detail Overview\n\nThis example shows all actual performance consumptions on all systems in one singly page.\n\n\f10.3.17 Munin Screen Overview\n\nWith the additional performance graphs every detailed measurement is shown in time series plots. Operators\ntherefore get a very detailed view of every single aspect of a service and host. With the help of the time series\nand the operational knowledge the operators get a very detailed insight on any impact from any service\nprovisioning to the systems.\n\n\fIn this example the network traffic incoming and outgoing is shown. This is a great tool to identify performance\nbottlenecks or as a great basis to enable forecasts.\n\n\f",

Fischer – May 04, 2011\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n\nScope and Preconditions\nThe three companies Gamma Group, Desoma and Dreamlab intend to create Telecommunication Intelligence\nSystems for different telecommunication networks to fulfill the customers‘ needs and requirements regarding\nLawful Interception, Massive Data Interception, Data Retention and traffic/application/protocol Control (Traffic\nBlocking and Shaping).\nThese different intelligence methods and technologies are to be deployed in different network environments like\n„classic“ fixed and mobile networks as well as in IP-based (packet oriented) networks. However, not every\ntechnology/method will be used in every network in the same way if it will be used at all.\nThe Intelligence Systems must be modular/scalable and have to be combined depending on the communication\nenvironments and needs in different project/countries.\nThe main expertise of all three partners is the „IP-world“. There should be some technological competence on\nDesoma‘s side regarding the classic networks (PSTN,Mobile), while Gamma has the world wide marktet access\nand competence regarding sales and marketing for all technologies mentioned above.\nBeside some „restrictions“ regarding specific knowledge (which has to be evaluated) there are for sure\nrestrictions regarding man power, time and money.\nA strategy has to be defined to create Intelligence System(s) which can be realized in a rather short period of\ntime to generate RoI, being\ncompetitive and making the most use of currently available knowledge and experience of all partners.\nThe following slides will give an overview of the different Intelligence Solutions‘ requirements and technologies\nand an indication regarding the

It might be possible to keep\ni.e.\nalso the subjects of Emails etc. (which extends the\nclassic\n\nMediation\n\nDRS).

More IP-knowledge than classic PSTN/Mobile NW knowledge available within the 3 partners\n2. Sales experience and market access is available for all solutions\n3. PSTN/Mobile Voice data need a complete different handling (receiving, decoding, evaluation) than IP-data\n4. No. 2 becomes even more difficult dealing with decoding of modem and fax transmissions\n5. LI for classic PSTN/Mobile NWs depend very much on the LI-implementations provided by the different NWvendors\n6. DRS is characterized by huge amounts of data, a wide range of different intefaces needed to capture/receive\ndata, different Hand-over-Interfaces (HI-A, HI-B) and different approaches when data are to be retrieved,\nown/different user management etc.\n7. Different Intelligence Methods need different kinds of administration functions\n8. Different Intelligence Methods need different ways of storage (data structures), different decoding and\nanalysis/evaluation methods\nThe proposed way to go should be:\n9. Start with Mass IP-Data Interception (for this Intelligence Method the most work is done / solutions are available)\n10. Next Step will be LI in IP-Networks (a lot of components can be used and/or are available and can be modified\naccordingly)\n11. Due to the fact that Infection solutions are products ready to use (FinFly ISP, FinFlyWeb, FinFlyUSB) the data\ncoming from FinSpy Master have to be integrated into the Data Warehouse (like we did for other MCs).\n12. Blocking and Shaping has no real impact on the Back-End because no data transfer towards the BE has to take\nplace. It can be kept as a separate product, making use of filter criteria also used for Mass IP-data Interception.\nHaving an own GUI running on the same Management Workstation like Mass IP Interception and/or LI and/or\nInfection will be sufficient.\n13. Although LI in PSTN/Mobile networks provide a lot of functions as part of the networks we still will need a lot of\nadditional equipment (HW/SW) to receive, decode and evaluate captured data. Maybe Appliances and Software\nfrom 3rd Parties might be a solution (ASC, Spectronic, others). For us integrating the data in the Warehouse then\nwould be the major task together with an overall System/Warrant administration. Interfacing to other data\n\n\fVielen Dank für die Aufmerksamkeit\n\n\n\f",

No packet\nincoming on port A and C will go out on port B or D.\n.\n\nINLINE2 mode:\n\nWhen setting up this configuration state the RD will forward all packets from port\nA to port B and vice versa and from port C to port D and vise versa. No packet will be\nsent in any other direction (from A to C or A to D or C to A or C to B).\nTAP mode:\nVersion 4.0\n\n\n\fBypass Programmer Guide\n\nForward all packets from port A to port C and also to port B (in parallel to both).\nForward all packets from port C to port A and also to port D (in parallel to both). Any\npacket incoming on port B and D will be dropped. No packet will be sent from port A to\nport D. No packet will be sent from port C to port B.\nMON1 mode:\n\nForward all packets from port A to port B.
